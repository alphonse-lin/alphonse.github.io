My personal [website](http://alphonse.github.io).

## About this site

This site runs on GitHub Pages and built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  The CSS was based largely on Barry Clark's [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).

I use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io) by Dave Gandy for many of the icons on the site.

Site design by the author, Al Fischer.

Code for the site (HTML, CSS, JS) is release under the MIT [license](https://github.com/alphonse/alphonse.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE).
