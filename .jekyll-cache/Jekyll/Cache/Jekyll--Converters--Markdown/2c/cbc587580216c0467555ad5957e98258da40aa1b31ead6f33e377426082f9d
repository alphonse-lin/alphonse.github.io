I"<p>Your lab notebook is the single <strong><em>exact, permanent, legally defensible, archival record</em></strong> of what you did in lab.  In an academic setting, notebooks are often used by the person who wrote the notebook or a lab colleague when trying to repeat an experiment, process data, or publish results.  In a professional setting, they may be used to communicate work to new employees, defend against patent lawsuits, or support forensic or toxicological conclusions in a court of law.  A good test of your lab notebook is to imagine handing it to a peer who has never completed the lab.  Then, try to determine if there would enough information for them to (1) complete the lab with no other resources, (2) <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> repeat your data analysis and calculations and arrive at the <strong><em>exact</em></strong> same answer (including all significant digits), and (3) understand your conclusions and how you arrived at those conclusions.  When in doubt, itâ€™s better to include too much than too little!</p>
