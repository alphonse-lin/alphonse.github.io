<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Review your list of 10 scientific claims from earlier in the semester.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose one claim to investigate in more detail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Turn in a 1- to 2-paragraph summary of your claim.</strong>  Elaborate a little more on the perceived basis for the claim and whether or not you think itâ€™s valid.  See if you can find the same (or a very similar) claim from other sources and include those in the summary.  Make sure you list the sources you find for the claims in a way that you could find them again.  Remember to include a title block on your assignment.</p>
