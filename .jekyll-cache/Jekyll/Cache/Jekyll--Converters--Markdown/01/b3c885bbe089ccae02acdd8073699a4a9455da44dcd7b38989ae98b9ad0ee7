<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Mendeley is a citation manager.  It is used to organize and cite references.  It is able to interface directly with Microsoft Word and more advanced bibliography software such as BibTeX/LaTeX.  There are other similar options available, including OneNote, Zotero, and Papers.  Although you aren’t required to use any of these, I suggest you choose one you like.  This document will discuss using Mendeley.</p>

If not, look for the DOI field, input the correct DOI number, and click the magnifying glass to search for information using the DOI number.  The DOI number can usually be found on the first page of the publication.  If that still doesn’t work you can input the information manually.</li>
