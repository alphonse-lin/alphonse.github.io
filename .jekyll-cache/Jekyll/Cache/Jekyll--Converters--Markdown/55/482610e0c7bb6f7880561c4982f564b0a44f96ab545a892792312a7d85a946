I"Ö<p>The introduction to the paper serves to orient the reader to the topic at hand and provide an <em>very brief</em> overview of the study at hand.  If youâ€™ve written a research paper or 5-paragraph essay for a class before, the introduction is much the same.  You can think of it as a 5-paragraph essay that makes up the first section of your paper (but donâ€™t necessarily limit yourself to the 5-paragraph format).  Of course, this means you will have to do research to write the intro!  It should convey what questions the study is asking, why itâ€™s asking those question, and what led the authorâ€™s to ask those questions.  It should also discuss any similar work thatâ€™s been done previously and describe how the authorâ€™s work relates to the previous studies.  Provide context by citing relevant <em>scholarly</em> sources.  There is no specific formula for what to include â€“ the intro is your chance to decide what you think is important for the reader to know.</p>
