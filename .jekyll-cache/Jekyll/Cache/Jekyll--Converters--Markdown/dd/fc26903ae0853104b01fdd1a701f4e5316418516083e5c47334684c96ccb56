<p>Please consider the advice in this yearâ€™s One Book, <em>We Need to Talk</em> by Celeste Headlee, when preparing for and participating in class discussions.  All discussion must adhere to WCUâ€™s policy on civil discourse.</p>

<p><strong>Civil Discourse at Western Carolina:</strong> Consistent with WCUâ€™s core values and our campus creed, the WCU community accepts the freedoms and responsibilities of our shared community. WCU encourages all to clearly express their own views while at the same time seeking to understand the varieties of style, identity, and opinion that are held in any diverse community. In order for us to sustain a learning environment that promotes and values freedom of expression, we have a shared charge to accept personal responsibility for our actions, reactions, and speech, while seeking to learn from the actions, reactions, and speech of others.</p>
