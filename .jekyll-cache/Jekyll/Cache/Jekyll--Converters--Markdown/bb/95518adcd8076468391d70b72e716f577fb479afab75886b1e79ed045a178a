<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Read <a href="https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2004-05/106-science-claims-and-truckful-baloney"><em>106 Science Claims and a Truckful of Baloney</em></a>, by William Speed Weed.  Please inform your instructor if you cannot find the article.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Over the next few days, observe your surroundings and compile a list of <strong>10 scientific claims</strong> that you encounter. They can be from packages, news articles, politicians, celebrities on Twitter, advertisements, <em>et cetera</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Turn in a list of your 10 claims with a 1- to 2-sentence summary of each.</strong>  Make sure to include where you found them with enough information that you could easily find them again.  Rate each claim for credibility from 0 to 5, where 0 is completely false and 5 is completely true.  An example of what to turn in is below.  You may not use any of the claims in the example!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  <li>
    <p>Sea otters have favorite rocks, which they store in their pockets.  Claim found on Twitter, FishOceansCAN, 8 Jul 2019.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>4, I did not know this, but it seems very plausible.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Nitrogen makes tires last longer.  Found on sign of Downtown Tire, Hendersonville, NC, 5 Jul 2019.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>2, Slight truth but overstated.  Air is mostly nitrogen, so any benefit would be very slight.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Epsom salts applied to plants “help seeds germinate” and “produce vitamins” for “higher yields and more blooms”.   Found on https://www.epsomsaltcouncil.org/uses-benefits/, 8 Jul 2019.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>3, mostly true, Epsom salts do not “produce vitamins”, they are vitamins.  Otherwise, they are well-known to yield stronger plants.</li>
    </ul>
