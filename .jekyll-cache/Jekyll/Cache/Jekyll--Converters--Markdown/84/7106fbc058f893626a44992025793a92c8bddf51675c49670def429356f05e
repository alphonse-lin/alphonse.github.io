<p>Before you begin, convert your spectrum from raw abundance (counts) into relative abundance (% of base peak).</p>

<h3 id="1-look-for-the-m-molecular-ion-peak">1. Look for the M<sup>.+</sup> (molecular ion) peak.</h3>

<p>The molecular ion, sometimes called the <em>parent peak</em>, is the highest mass peak of significance in the spectrum (except for the M<sup>.+</sup> + 1, …, etc. peaks).  It represents the unfragmented molecule, and can therefore tell you the <em>monoisotopic</em> mass of the analyte.  Not all compounds yield an M<sup>.+</sup> peak; some are too unstable.  Some compounds yield very abundant M<sup>.+</sup> peaks; this stability can be a clue to the structure.</p>

<h3 id="2-use-m--1-peak-to-figure-out-c-count">2. Use M<sup>.+</sup> + 1 peak to figure out C count.</h3>

<p>Zoom in on the M<sup>.+</sup> peak and look for a very small, but real, peak 1 <em>m/z</em> unit above your molecular ion peak.  This peak is usually present for small, organic molecules and represents the fraction of the molecules containing one <sup>13</sup>C atom.  Take the ratio of these two abundances and divide by the natural abundance of <sup>13</sup>C to find the approximate number (+/- 1) of carbon atoms in the molecule.  (Or, remember, a ratio of 1.1 = 1C, 2.2 = 2 C, 3.3 = 3 C, …)</p>

<p>The  M<sup>.+</sup> + 1 peak must be the highest mass in the spectrum, an odd-electron ion, and give logical, neutral losses (see 4 and 6 below). If you don’t see an obvious M<sup>.+</sup> + 1 peak or see multiple peaks in distinct patterns, you may have halogens or other non-C,H,O,N atoms in your molecule.</p>

<h3 id="3-apply-the-nitrogen-rule">3. Apply the nitrogen rule.</h3>

<p>Is M<sup>.+</sup> odd or even? For small, organic molecules an even M<sup>.+</sup> strongly suggests an even number of nitrogen atoms (0 is even), and an odd molecular weight (M<sup>.+</sup>) suggests an odd number of nitrogen atoms.</p>

<h3 id="4-calculate-rings-and-double-bonds-degree-of-unsaturation">4. Calculate rings and double bonds (degree of unsaturation).</h3>

<p>C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>N<sub>z</sub>O<sub>n</sub> will have <em>x</em> - 0.5<em>y</em> + 0.5<em>z</em> + 1 rings and/or double bonds.  Integers represent odd-electron ions; results ending in 0.5 represent even-electron ions.</p>

<h3 id="5-look-for-the-base-peak">5. Look for the base peak.</h3>

<p>The base peak is the largest peak in the spectrum (relative abundance = 100%).  It represents the most stable fragment (keeping in mind that some “fragments” are actually rearrangements).</p>

<h3 id="6-calculate-the-identity-of-each-peak-using-steps-2-4">6. Calculate the identity of each peak using steps 2-4.</h3>

<p>Attempt to identify any peaks possible.  Look for logical losses (e.g. -OH or -CH<sub>3</sub>) and series of logical losses (e.g. -CH<sub>3</sub>, -CH<sub>2</sub>).  Look for isotopic abundances of fragments and assign compositions.  The nitrogen rule still applies to fragments, but keep in mind any odd-mass element could cause the same result.  When you’ve identified as many peaks as you can, attempt to deduce a structure.</p>
