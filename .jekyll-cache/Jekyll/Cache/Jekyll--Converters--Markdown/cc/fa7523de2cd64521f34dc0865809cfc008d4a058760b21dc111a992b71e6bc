I"ˆ<p>These resources are meant to supplement the data processing instructions provided in the lab manual.  You are not required to view the videos if you feel you can do the data processing without them.  But if you run into problems or questions, please refer to the videos first; Iâ€™ve included outlines to help you find the relevant parts.  These activities are meant to be self-paced.</p>
