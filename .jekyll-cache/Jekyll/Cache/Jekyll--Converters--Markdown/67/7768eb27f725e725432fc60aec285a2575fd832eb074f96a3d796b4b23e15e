I"ã<p>The <em>Results and Discussion</em> section serves two purposes: (1) to present the results (data) and (2) to put those results into context with a thoughtful discussion about whether the results were anticipated, how they compare to previous work, and how they can be explained using models, theories, general knowledge, and reasoning.  Note that the results section should be a <em>logical argument</em> based on evidence, not a chronological description of the experiment.</p>
