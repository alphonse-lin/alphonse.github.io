# Introduction

This assignment covers Chapter 2 of [*Analytical Chemistry 2.1*](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_(Harvey)/02%3A_Basic_Tools_of_Analytical_Chemistry) by Harvey.  It is a review of basic chemical principles you have studied in the past.

Consult [Scientific Tools](https://alphonse.github.io/archive/chem191-f2019/pdf/scientific-tools-stull.pdf) by Roland Stull for a concise overview of these topics.

The activities here are based on both of these texts.

*You should work in groups to complete this activity.* 

*Remember to maintain physical distance even when working in groups!*  You may use the whiteboards to aid in working through problems.

# Units and Dimensions

Scientists often talk in numbers and charts.  When presenting these items, it is important that we all use the same language and clearly specify our units so that we avoid [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter).

> There are seven basic dimensions from which we base all other measurements; these define the SI (international system) *base units*.  All other units are *derived units*.  
>
> Any data value may be broken into four parts:   
> 
> **value = number x magnitude x prefix x units**
> For example:   
<!-- > concentration value = $$ 1.3 \times 10^{-3} $$ M -->

$$ 1.3 \times 10^{-3} $$
