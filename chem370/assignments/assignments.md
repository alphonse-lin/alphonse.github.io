You should expect to spend ~15 hours per week spent working on materials for Instrumental Analysis.  This corresponds to 3-4 hours per credit hour.  I will do my best to spread this out equally over the semester, but some weeks will inevitably be more demanding than others.  An overview of assignments and due dates is given below.

# Typical Weekly Schedule

| Sunday                           | Monday                      | Tuesday | Wednesday                   | Thursday | Friday                     | Saturday |
|:-------------------------------- |:--------------------------- |:------- |:--------------------------- |:-------- |:-------------------------- |:-------- |
| **Lecture** materials due        | In-class meeting (cohort 1) |         | In-class meeting (cohort 2) | Lab      | Occasional Review Sessions |          |
| New content posted by instructor |                             |         | **Lab** materials due       |          | (Zoom) Office Hours        |          |

# Lecture Assignments

All videos, readings, and weekly quizzes are due by 23:59:59 (midnight) on Sunday of each week.  For example, the week 2 videos and quiz are due on Sunday at the end of week 2/beginning of week 3.

Exams will occur during the in-person meeting for the date listed.

This class uses a "flipped" format, so a significant portion of your homework consists of watching the videos and completing the readings.  Plan for 1-2 hours of thorough reading and an hour of video each week (occasionally more) with additional time spent reviewing topics from previous weeks (aka studying!). Problem sets will usually be completed in class, but you are strongly encouraged to work through problems in the book on your own.  Additional readings and homework assignments may be assigned periodically throughout the semester based on class progress and weekly activities.

# Lab Assignments

Lab assignments are due at 23:59:59 (midnight) the night before lab.  For example, for Thursday lab, all assignments will be due at 23:59:59 on Wednesday night (unless otherwise specified).  

A check list of assignments is provided below to help you keep track of your assignments.  Due dates are listed on the [submissions page]({{site.url}}/chem370/submissions).
