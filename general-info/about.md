I am the Instrumentation Specialist and an Instructor of Chemistry at Western Carolina University.  My interests lie at the intersection of environmental science and analytical chemistry.  I develop instruments and methods that help us better understand the natural world and our effects on it.  To learn more, please see my [CV](http://alphonse.github.io/curriculum-vitae/) or feel free to [get in touch](mailto:dfischer@wcu.edu)!


## Expertise

* Design and automation of chemical instrumentation
