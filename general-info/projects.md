<!-- My skills and interests are broad: I'm part chemist, part enginner, and part naturalist.  I've worked on a diverse array of projects - both formally and informally - some of which are listed here. -->

# Research Projects

I have research projects available in all of the areas listed below.  I welcome both graduate and undergraduate into my lab.  If you are student interested in one of these projects please send me an [email](mailto:dfischer@wcu.edu)!

## Instrumentation and Electronics

The primary focus of my lab is the development of new instrumentation.  Some current and past projects are listed below.  These projects involve a lot of designing, building, programming, and trial and error.

- [A 4-wavlength Photoacoustic Spectrometer](/assets/pdf/poster_pas_aaar_2017_al-fischer.pdf) (past)

- [Cavity Enhanced Spectroscopy](/assets/pdf/poster_bbces_ces_2015_al-fischer.pdf) (past)

- **A NIR broadband caivty enhanced spectrometer**

- **A low-cost photoacoustic spectrometer (current)**

- [Low-cost Aerosol Sensors](https://dr-fischer.github.io/wheeCAIR/grsm_purchase-2019.html) (current): We build low cost (~$100), battery-powered, portable nephelometeric for hyper-local monitoring of particulate matter concentration and personal exposure in Western North Carolina.  And example of the of the device's response to woodsmoke is shown in the figure below.

- DOBSUN: An Arduino-based Dobson meter and sun photometer (on hold)
