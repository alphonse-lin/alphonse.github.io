<!-- My skills and interests are broad: I'm part chemist, part enginner, and part naturalist.  I've worked on a diverse array of projects - both formally and informally - some of which are listed here. -->

# Research Projects

I have research projects available in areas of instrument development, environmental analysis, and chemical ecology and phytochemistry.  I welcome both graduate and undergraduate students into my lab to work on any of these projects.  If you are a student interested in any of them send me an [email](dfischer@wcu.edu)!

## Instrumentation and Electronics

The primary focus of my research is the development of new instrumentation.  Some current and past projects are listed below.  These projects involve a lot of designing, building, programming, and trial and error.

- [A 4-wavlength Photoacoustic Spectrometer for Aerosols](/assets/pdf/poster_pas_aaar_2017_al-fischer.pdf) (past)

- [UV-vis Cavity Enhanced Spectrometer for Aerosols](/assets/pdf/poster_bbces_ces_2015_al-fischer.pdf) (past)

- **A NIR broadband cavity enhanced spectrometer** (active)

- **A low-cost photoacoustic spectrometer** (active)

- [Low-cost Aerosol Sensors](https://dr-fischer.github.io/wheeCAIR/grsm_purchase-2019.html) (active): We build low cost (~$100), battery-powered, portable nephelometeric sensors for hyper-local monitoring of particulate matter concentration and personal exposure in Western North Carolina.  An example of the device's response to woodsmoke is shown in the figure below.

- DOBSUN: An Arduino-based Dobson meter and sun photometer (on hold)
