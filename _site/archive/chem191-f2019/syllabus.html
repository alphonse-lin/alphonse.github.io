<p><a id="policies-course"></a></p>

<h1 id="the-fine-print">The Fine Print…</h1>

<h2 id="course-policies">Course Policies</h2>

<p><strong>Classroom Expectations:</strong> The shared learning space of the college classroom is built on respect for each other and each other’s learning. Learning together means our actions can intentionally and unintentionally distract others from their learning goals. As responsible learners who respect the rights of others and vow to minimize avoidable distractions such as: non-academic technology use, coming in late, sleeping, off-topic discussions, doing other homework, eating, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> Please email your instructor <em>ahead of time</em> if you encounter circumstances that absolutely prevent you from making it to class on time.  Attendance to all class periods is mandatory. Absences from group work sessions may incur a loss of points up to a zero for the assignment and deductions in the student’s participation grade.</p>

<p><strong>Inclement Weather:</strong> Please check the University website for campus closings during times of bad weather.  Your safety is a priority when traveling. Use common sense when attempting to get to campus and notify your instructor if you are unable to safely make it.  Announcements will be made via e-mail if class must be cancelled when the University has not officially closed.</p>

<p><strong>Composition-Condition Marks:</strong> Proper mastery of the English language will be considered when assessing written work. A student whose written work fails to meet acceptable standards will be assigned a composition-condition (CC) mark by the instructor on the final grade report. All undergraduates who receive two CC grades prior to the semester in which they complete 110 hours at WCU are so notified by the registrar and are required to pass English 300 or English 401 before they will be eligible for graduation. This course must be taken within two semesters of receiving the second CC and must be passed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. Students needing assistance with writing are encouraged to get help from WaLC. All written work submitted for this class may be checked with SafeAssign.</p>

<p><strong>Civil Discourse at Western Carolina:</strong> Consistent with WCU’s core values and our campus creed, the WCU community accepts the freedoms and responsibilities of our shared community. WCU encourages all to clearly express their own views while at the same time seeking to understand the varieties of style, identity, and opinion that are held in any diverse community. In order for us to sustain a learning environment that promotes and values freedom of expression, we have a shared charge to accept personal responsibility for our actions, reactions, and speech, while seeking to learn from the actions, reactions, and speech of others.</p>

<!-- Proper Laboratory Attire: Students must arrive to lab wearing appropriate attire. Students without appropriate attire will be asked to leave and will not be able to complete the activity for the day (and will be counted absent). Students who forget their goggles may “rent” a pair for a cost of 5 points subtracted from their grade.

- Wear goggles at all times (whenever you are in the room).
- Wear closed-toed shoes that fully cover your feet up to the ankle at all times.
- Wear long pants that extend over the top of your shoes at all times.
- Wear a hair tie for long hair.
- Never wear tank tops, sleeveless shirts, shorts, or sandals.

Laboratory Behavior: Never bring food or drink into the laboratory. This includes sealed bottles and items inside backpacks – leave them outside the lab! Do not chew gum, use tobacco products, or apply cosmetics in the lab. Do not place personal items inside fume hoods or where they may come into contact with chemicals. Keep walkways clear of chairs, bookbags, etc. Wash your hands before leaving lab, and never wear gloves or labcoats outside the lab! -->

<!-- Certain chemicals can have severe harmful effects on unborn children. Any student who is pregnant or might have become pregnant and wished to avoid these hazards should notify her TA or instructor before conducting any laboratory work so that proper safety precautions can be taken. -->

<p><a id="policies-institution"></a></p>

<h2 id="institutional-policies">Institutional Policies</h2>
<p><strong>Course Recording and Broadcasting:</strong> Students may make visual or audio recordings (Recording) of any class related content, using any approved recording device (e.g., smart phone, computer, digital recorder, etc.) upon the <strong>prior permission of the instructor</strong> and subject to the following restriction(s). The Recording, along with the video capture of visible course materials (e.g., visible PowerPoint slides and/or visible lecture notes), shall be limited to the student’s personal, course related, educational use and shall be subject to all applicable copyright laws and institutional policies. The student may not transfer, transmit, or otherwise disseminate the Recording to any third party, including classmates, without the permission of the instructor. Any violation of these restrictions, or any other restriction verbally communicated by the instructor, may subject the student to the provisions of the WCU Academic Integrity Policy, the WCU Code of Student Conduct or both.</p>

<p><strong>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:</strong> Western Carolina University is committed to providing equal educational opportunities for students with documented disabilities and/or medical conditions. Students who require accommodations must identify themselves as having a disability and/or medical condition and provide current diagnostic documentation to the Office of Accessibility Resources.

<p><strong>Academic Integrity Policy and Reporting Process:</strong> This policy addresses academic integrity violations of undergraduate and graduate students. Students, faculty, staff, and administrators of Western Carolina University strive to achieve the highest standards of scholarship and integrity. Any violation of the Academic Integrity Policy is a serious offense because it threatens the quality of scholarship and undermines the integrity of the community. While academic in scope, any violation of this policy is by nature, a violation of the Code of Student Conduct and will follow the same conduct process (see ArticleVII.B.1.a.). If the charge occurs close to the end of an academic semester or term or in the event of the reasonable need of either party for additional time to gather information timelines may be extended at the discretion of the Department of Student Community Ethics (DSCE).</p>

<p>Instructors have the right to determine the appropriate academic sanctions for violations of the Academic Integrity Policy within their courses, up to and including a final grade of “F” in the course in which the violation occurs.</p>

<p>Definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Cheating</em>: Using, or attempting to use, unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise.</li>
  <li><em>Fabrication</em>: Creating and/or falsifying information or citation in any academic exercise.</li>
  <li><em>Plagiarism</em>: Representing the words or ideas of someone else as one’s own in any academic exercise.</li>
  <li><em>Facilitation</em>: Helping or attempting to help someone to commit a violation of the Academic Integrity Policy in any academic exercise (e.g. allowing another person to copy information during an examination).</li>
