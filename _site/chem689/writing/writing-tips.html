<h3 id="writing-guidelines-based-on-common-mistakes">Writing guidelines (based on common mistakes):</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Revise, revise, revise!  No writing is ever perfect the first time through; write, read, and revise!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make your report thorough yet concise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be specific.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Bad:</em> Samples were <del>heated</del> in an oven overnight.</li>
      <li><em>Good:</em> Samples were placed in an <strong>80°C oven for 8 hours</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid unnecessary words and phrases.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Bad:</em> <del>It has been reported that</del> air pollution 7 million deaths per year.</li>
      <li><em>Good:</em> Air pollution causes 7 million deaths per year [Ref 1].</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid too many/uncommon abbreviations, and define abbreviations the first time used (with a few exceptions, below); abbreviations should be appropriate for your audience.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Abbreviations that do not need to be defined:</em> Element names (Cu) and well-known units (m, ml, °C, K, etc.)</li>
      <li><em>Good abbreviations, when defined:</em> Instrumental techniques, certain chemicals that are more commonly/easily known by their abbreviation (e.g. 4-MP).</li>
      <li><em>Bad abbreviations:</em> Tylenol (T-ol), acetaminophen (AM)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use first-person active voice.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Bad:</em> <del>A GC-MS was used to perform a scent analysis on garlic.  Samples were prepared for analysis thusly:  To a sample vial, 1 g of garlic was chopped and added.</del></li>
      <li><em>Good:</em> We analyzed the scent of garlic using GC-MS.  We chopped 1 g of garlic and placed it in a sample vial for analysis.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use past tense for observations and methods.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Bad:</em> Tylenol-brand tablets <del>contain</del> 5% less acetaminophen than advertised.</li>
