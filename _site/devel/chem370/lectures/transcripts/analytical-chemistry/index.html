<h1 id="modern-analytical-chemistry">Modern Analytical Chemistry</h1>

<p>In the last lesson we discussed how analytical chemists take non-routine analysis problems and make them routine. We spoke generally about analytical chemistry. In this lesson we’ll focus more on the subset of analytical chemistry called instrumental analysis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Analytical chemistry is the science of inventing and applying the concepts, principles, and…strategies for measuring the characteristics of chemical systems.</p>

  <p>-David Harvey<br />
Analytical Chemistry 2.1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ve studied how flame atomic absorption spectroscopy came to be and observed how it’s largely supplanted gravimetric methods of metal analysis. Flame AA is an example of an instrumental analysis – using electronic instruments in analytical chemistry. If you take a look around any modern chemistry lab you’ll almost certainly find chemical instrumentation.</p>

<p>But what is an <em>instrument</em>?  Simply, an instrument is an electronic and/or optical assembly used to study the chemical properties of a sample.  Most instruments today are controlled by a computer, but there’s nothing stating an instrument <em>must</em> be computer controlled.  More specifically, an instrument for chemical analysis converts chemical or physical information into numerical information a chemist can directly interpret.  You might think of it as a translator between the chemical system under study and the investigator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Chemical instrumentation</strong> refers to electronic and/or optical devices used to study the chemical properties of a sample.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="chemical-instrumentation">Chemical Instrumentation</h1>

<p>As a general rule, all chemical instrumentation works by probing the system with an energy source and observing the result with a detector.  For example, a UV-visible spectrometer uses probes the sample with UV-visible light and detects how much of that light is transmitted through the sample.</p>

<p>In this class, we’ll focus on three broad categories of instrumentation, and most instruments you encounter in a chemistry lab will fall into one of these categories: (1) chromatography, which is used to separate mixtures, (2) spectroscopy, which utilizes light to probe a sample, and (3) mass spectrometry, which is used to identify chemicals based on mass.  The last of these (mass spec) is sometimes grouped under spectroscopy because both techniques produce a “spectrum”; however, the two techniques are quite different (as we shall see).</p>

     click C callback "Mass spectrometry is used for structural determination"
</div>

<div class="image-caption-center">The categories of instruments we'll cover in this class: chromatography, spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry.</div>

<p>You’ve surely encountered some of these techniques before, even if without realizing it.  You’ve used thin-layer chromatography and column chromatography in the organic chemistry lab, which rely on the same principles as the chromatographs we’ll use in instrumental analysis and you’ve done spectroscopy in the form of FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) and NMR (nulcear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy.  Even for the techniques that are new to you you’ll find they all rely on the same chemical principles you’ve learned in previous classes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we introduce new techniques, it is important that you incorporate them in the context of the techniques with which you are already familiar.</p>

  <p>-Granger et al. <br />
Instrumental Analysis</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>You’ve likely seen instruments on shows such as CSI before.  While these shows rightly depict that the fields of forensic science and medicine rely heavily on chemical instrumentation, they tend to oversimplify the process of making a measurement.  In these shows, the sample is usually popped into an instrument and results are displayed within seconds on the screen.  But what has to be done before the sample goes into the instrument?  And how to the technicians using the instruments know they’re right?  And herein lies a hurdle for those learning to use instruments: An instrument with always give you a result, but the result is not always the correct answer.  If you put garbage in, you’ll get garbage out.  It is up to the analyst to use proper sample preparation, quality control, and data validation techniques to ensure the instrument is producing <em>accurate</em> results!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Garbage in, garbage out!</p>

  <p>-D.C. Harris<br />
Quantitative Chemical Analysis</p>

<h1 id="standard-methods">Standard Methods</h1>

<p>Fortunately for the analyst, many agencies employ analytical chemists for the sole purpose of developing standard methods and protocols for the techniques we’ll cover in this course.  The terminology can get confusing here, so it helps to go over some definitions.  The book defines the following terms (reprinted verbatim from <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_%28Harvey%29/03%3A__The_Vocabulary_of_Analytical_Chemistry/3.02%3A_Techniques%2C_Methods%2C_Procedures%2C_and_Protocols"><em>Analytical Chemistry 2.1</em></a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Technique:</strong> any chemical or physical principle that we can use to study an analyte.  In this course, ‘technique’ is nearly synonymous with ‘instrument’.</li>
  <li><strong>Method:</strong> the application of a technique for a specific type of sample.</li>
  <li><strong>Procedure:</strong> a set of written directions that tell us how to apply a method to a particular sample, including information on how to collect the sample, how to handle interferents, and how to validate results.</li>
  <li><strong>Protocol:</strong> a set of stringent guidelines that specify a procedure that an analyst must follow if an agency is to accept the results.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the use of these terms is not consistent even among profession chemists.  In fact, the EPA terms their protocols “standard methods”, not protocols.  In general, methods are applications of techniques, procedures  include a method along with the sample preparation steps, and a protocol specifies <em>exactly</em> which methods and procedures should be followed to obtain high-quality data.  The term protocol often implies legal standing.  A protocol is usually followed if a government agencies is to accept the results of an analysis.  It is the application of one or more methods and procedures to obtain legally-defensible results.</p>

<h1 id="sample-preparation">Sample Preparation</h1>

<p>The first step toward acquiring reliable data is proper sample preparation.  Most instruments require the sample in a liquid (or sometimes gaseous) form for analysis.  For some samples, such as an organic synthesis product, this isn’t a problem.  But what happens when you want to determine how much acetaminophen is contained in a Tylenol tablet or how much mercury is in a can of tuna fish?  In these cases the sample must undergo some sort of <em>sample preparation</em>, wherein the samples are ground up and extracted in solvent, digested in acid, or otherwise turned into a liquid form, and the residual solids are filtered out. Often, this sample preparation includes a dilution step as well, as many samples (even “pure” tap water) may be too concentrated for most modern instruments.</p>

<p>When preparing and analyzing samples, we often talk about the <strong>analyte</strong> and the <strong>matrix</strong>.  The analyte is the portion of the sample you’re analyzing, while the matrix is everything else in the sample.  When we refer to a <strong>sample</strong>, we’re referring to the combined analyte and matrix.  As an example, let’s say we’re trying to determine the nicotine concentration in e-cigarette liquid (“vape juice”). These liquids consist of a small amount of nicotine and flavoring agents in a bulk liquid of ~50:50 propylene glycol:vegetable glycerin (the exact ratio is often adjusted to control the characteristics of the aerosol or “smoke”).  The analyte in this case would be nicotine. The matrix would be vegtable glycerine, propylene glycol, and any flavoring agents or other additives in the liquid.  As you might imagine, the analyte may behave differently in different matrices, or samples with different matrices may behave differently in an instrument.  For example, some instruments rely on the ability to draw up a small, precise amount of liquid.  A very viscous liquid such as proylene glycol will draw up differently than than a less viscous liquid like water, and all of these factors must be taken into account when preparing samples and standards.  Now that we’ve discussed the analyte and matrix, we should more precisely define the term <strong>method</strong> (as described above).  A method details how to use a technique for a specific analyte in a specific matrix.</p>

<div class="check-understanding">

What do the terms analyte and matrix refer to?

<label class="tooltip-understand" style="top: 50%; left: 20px; font-size: 14px;">
 ANSWER 
 <input type="checkbox" />
   <span>
      The analyte is the chemical species of interest; the matrix is everything else.
   </span>
</label>
</div>

<h1 id="data-quality">Data Quality</h1>

<p>Much work conducted on instruments is meant to be <em>quantitative</em>.  This requires standardization, and for rigorous work, a host of quality control measures that give us proof the data are accurate.  These steps are part of your procedure, but may be specified in a protocol.  For example, the EPA defines exactly how to make the standards, blanks, and quality control samples (“QCs”) for quantifying metal concentration in drinking water, and even the order in which to run them!  If you don’t follow their method (or an accepted EPA equivalent method) your results will not be sufficient for EPA reporting purposes.  The next lesson will layout the terminology and underlying principles we use to discuss the quality of our data, and from there we’ll move into discussing specific standardization methods.</p>
