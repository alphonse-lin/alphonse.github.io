  <h1>An Analytical Perspective </h1>
  

  <div style="font-weight: bold;">Al Fischer, PhD</div>
  <div>Chem 370 | Instrumental Analysis</div>
  
  <div class="entry">
    <p>Hello everyone, and welcome to Instrumental Analysis!</p>

<p>I want to spend some time in this first lecture going working to understand how instrumental analysis fits into to the field of chemistry and into the scientific community as a whole.</p>

<p>Instrumental analysis is a subset of analytical chemistry, and these two fields of study are deeply intertwined.</p>

<p>I know you’ve all done analytical chemistry in the past.  For example, you’ve collected IR and NMR spectra in Organic lab to ID your product.  And you’ve studied the topic in more detail during Quantitative Analysis.</p>

<p>In fact, we’ll take many of the concepts you learned in Quant and apply them in new settings in this class.  I’ll spend the next few lectures reviewing the most important concepts from Quant, and I’ll start today by attempting to define <em>analytical chemistry</em>.</p>

<p>There’s our roadmap – now let’s dive in!</p>

<h1 id="so-what-is-analytical-chemistry">So, what is analytical chemistry?</h1>

<p>The chemist Charles N. Reilly of UNC Chapel Hill said in a speech to the American Chemical Society, <em>Analytical chemistry is what analytical chemists do.</em>  What he meant by this is that we should focus less on our predisposed notion of what the field encompasses and instead focus on the current research topics.  And in fact, this tends to be how the analytical chemistry works – it evolves over time to encompass many areas of research, all linked by a central reliance on chemical analysis. (So is all chemistry “analytical chemistry”?)  I’ll start off here by providing my thoughts on the current scope of analytical chemistry and then go over a historic example of analytical method development as a demonstration of the analytical process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Analytical chemistry is what analytical chemists do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Going back to Dr. Reilly’s definition, it may at first seem quite ambiguous; however, I believe it’s in fact quite fitting.  Analytical chemistry often becomes a “catch-all” discipline for the more interdisciplinary areas of chemistry, biochemistry, and nanomaterials research, thus often escaping simple definition (though perhaps this should not be so!).  As we go through the semester, you’ll find the portions of analytical chemistry concerned with <em>instrumental analysis</em> often draw on numerous fields, including chemistry, physics, engineering, computer science, and statistics.  Likewise, it plays an integral role in all branches of chemistry.</p>

<p>In his speech, which he delivered in 1965, Dr. Reilly was urging the field to reconsider how it teaches analytical chemistry.   At the time, we taught analytical chemistry as essentially equilibrium chemistry, although the field had recently become increasingly reliant on chemical separations and spectroscopy.  Reilly suggested this change be reflected in analytical classes, and the field largely followed his advice.</p>

<p>Almost 30 years later (1994), Royce Murray (also of UNC Chapel Hill) revisited the prevailing definition of analytical chemistry, and again suggested change.  He specifically recognized that modern chemical instrumentation had become the dominant driver of research in analytical chemistry and also that strong statistical treatment of data had become an integral part of analytical chemistry.  Of course, he suggested changes that mirrored these trends, and concluded <em>‘Analytical chemistry is [still] what analytical chemists do.’</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‘Analytical chemistry is [still] what analytical chemists do.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, we once again see that the field of analytical chemistry has progressed almost 30 years since then Dr. Murray re-published that quote.  The reliance of the field on new forms of technology means that the capabilities, preferred techniques, and research foci change rapidly.  For example, modern analytical chemistry has grown increasingly reliant on data science tools that allow multivariate (chemometric) analysis of the data.  My goal for this semester is to integrate some of this cutting edge work into the class while covering enough of the foundations that you’ll have a solid understanding of analytical chemistry and instrumental analysis by the end of the semester.</p>

<h1 id="a-more-refined-definition">A more refined definition</h1>

<p>So if analytical chemistry is continually changing and evolving (just as any field is), we need some historical context to reach a more refined definition for the field.</p>

<p>For much of the past century or so, chemists have been grouped in one of 5 categories: inorganic, organic, physical, analytical, and biochemistry.  Although the interdisciplinary nature of modern chemistry has blurred these lines a bit, searching many university websites will reveal this trend even today. But where might someone researching nanoparticle optical properties for cancer applications fit?  They create inorganic materials, but in the form of nanomaterials; they study physical chemistry, but in a biological context; and they do biology, yet this is not the focus of their work; and surely, they conduct plenty of chemical analysis!</p>

<p>Hopefully this gives you some idea of what an analytical chemist <em>might</em> look like today.  Historically, classical analytical chemistry has used wet chemical methods such as extractions, distillations, and precipitations followed by qualitative observations of color, odor, and reactivity (among other properties).  In the case of quantitative analysis, many methods were either <em>gravimetric</em> or <em>volumetric</em> – that is they relied on changes in mass or volume to determine the amount of a substance present.</p>

<p>Today, most analytical chemistry probably rely on instrumental analysis to make their measurements.  This means they use electronic equipment that often separates the components of their sample and analyzes it by recording how it interacts with light, heat, or electric fields.</p>

<p>So, looking broadly, perhaps a reasonable definition of analytical chemistry is <em>the field concerned with</em> <strong>qualitatively</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>quantitatively</strong> <em>characterizing matter.</em>  While this may suffice, I think it fails to capture the true motives of an analytical chemist.</p>

<p>Consider, for example, the difference between <em>analytical chemistry</em> and <em>chemical analysis</em>.  They may seem synonymous at first glance, but there’s a small difference: an analytical chemist is not concerned simply with <em>characterizing</em> or <em>analyzing</em> a sample. That is chemical analysis.  Rather, the analytical chemist is concerned with the <em>measurement</em>: how it’s made, how well it’s made, and – importantly – how it can be improved or streamlined.  As David Harvey writes in <em>Analytical Chemistry 2.1</em>, <em>To an analytical chemist, the process of making a useful measurement is critical; if the measurement is not of central importance to the work, then it is not analytical chemistry.</em>  So we see this definition ignores the unique perspective an analytical chemist brings to a study.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To an analytical chemist, the process of making a useful measurement is critical; if the measurement is not of central importance to the work, then it is not analytical chemistry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To elaborate on this difference, let’s consider a mining company concerned with extracting nickel from ore.  Say they’ve found a geologic formation that contains Ni, and they’d like to know whether or not it’s profitable to develop a mine and sell the Ni.  Their focus is on understanding only how much Ni is in the ore.  As such, they’d use a well-known, reliable method to determine the nickel concentration in their ore, and would use that same method day in and day out.  The gravimetric method developed Fresenius in the late nineteenth century is an example of a classical analytical method that would work.</p>

<p><a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/159815/Figure1_1.png?revision=1&amp;size=bestfit&amp;width=748&amp;height=910"><img src="https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/159815/Figure1_1.png" class="img-center-v" /></a></p>

<div class="image-caption-center"> Fresenius’ analytical scheme for the gravimetric analysis of Ni in ores, CC-BY-SA from <a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_%28Harvey%29/01%3A_Introduction_to_Analytical_Chemistry/1.01%3A_What_is_Analytical_Chemistry">Analytical Chemistry 2.1</a></div>

<p>Notice how this method takes a total of 58 hours!  It also requires many steps (i.e. spots to introduce error) and a number of hazardous chemicals.  Nevertheless, it’s suitable for their purposes so they keep using it.</p>

<p>While this may work for an analyst (i.e. someone concerned only with determining how much nickel is present) it raises the eyebrows of an analytical chemist.  In fact, analytical chemists developed a much simpler method in the early 1900s.  The total time to completion was reduced by 70% and number of steps was minimized.  The new method is not only quicker, but uses fewer chemicals, is less prone to error, and ultimately less costly.  Such a method could then be adopted by analysts at the mining company to maximize profitability in the lab.</p>

<p><a href="https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/159828/Figure-1_2.jpg"><img src="https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/159828/Figure-1_2.jpg" class="img-center-h" /></a></p>

<p>Today, most Ni determination would be done with instrumental methods developed in the middle part of the last century. (More on those in a few minutes!)  But hopefully you’re beginning to see that analytical chemistry tends to focus on the process of refining the measurement more than the specific outcome of the measurement. (That’s why not all chemistry is analytical chemistry!)</p>

<p>We can see further support for this by looking at leading journals in the field.  The American Chemical Society publishes a journal devoted to the topic, called (rightly so) <em>Analytical Chemistry</em>.  A good way to understand the current state of the field is to browse the articles in this journal, and I’d encourage you to do that (you have access through the library).  But we can also look at their own description of the type of work they seek to publish:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Topics commonly include chemical reactions and selectivity, chemometrics and data processing, electrochemistry, elemental and molecular characterization, imaging, instrumentation, mass spectrometry, microscale and nanoscale systems, -omics, sensing, separations, spectroscopy, and surface analysis. <strong><em>Papers dealing with established analytical methods need to offer a significantly improved, original application of the method.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So <em>analytical chemistry</em> is concerned with developing and improving methods, while <em>chemical analysis</em> is concerned with utilizing those methods. We can further refine our definition and say that <strong><em>analytical chemistry is the field concerned with creating and improving analytical processes</em></strong>.  However, this is not to say analytical chemistry and analysis never overlap.  An analytical chemist will often find themselves conducting routine analysis.  This class (and especially the laboratory) aims to prepare you for work in chemical analysis, and provides a stepping stone into analytical chemistry.  (At WCU, Instrumental Analysis II tends to focus more heavily on method development.)</p>

<h1 id="analytical-perspective">Analytical Perspective</h1>

<p>Now that we’ve determined analytical chemistry is concerned with developing and refining methods, let’s look at how one might go about that that.  In studying analytical methods, we can see that the life cycle of method consists of7 stages [<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00470406">1</a>, <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ed077p577">2</a>]:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Conception</li>
  <li>Demonstration (Validation)</li>
  <li>Establishment of capabilities</li>
  <li>Widespread acceptance</li>
  <li>Continued development (e.g. commercialization)</li>
  <li>Cycling through steps 3-5</li>
  <li>Replacement/Death</li>
</ol>

<p>As hinted previously, an analytical chemist (especially one concerned with instrumental analysis) will draw on many fields while navigating this process.  Lets again look at the example of determining Ni concentration in ore.  Modern methods of nickel determination no longer rely on gravimetry (the process of determining by weight).  Instead, they rely on instrumental methods of analysis.</p>

<h2 id="conception-of-a-method">Conception of a Method</h2>

<p>The gravimetric methods for determining metal content had already been supplanted by atomic emissions spectroscopy when Sir Alan Walsh began his tenure at CSIRO (Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organisation) in Austrailia.  In these methods, metal samples are heated in a flame and a detector is used to observe which wavelengths of light are emitted.  The more light emitted, the more metal there is in the sample. Each metal emits a specific wavelength, and thus each metal is easily discernable. Although these methods were more sensitive than prior methods, they did not meet the needs of Walsh and CSIRO, who wished to measure minute traces of metals.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Flametest--Na.swn.jpg/720px-Flametest--Na.swn.jpg" class="img-portrait" /></p>

<div class="image-caption-center"> Emission of orange light by sodium atoms in a flame.

<p>Sir Alan Walsh is largely credited with developing another method of analyzing metals, called flame atomoic absorption spectroscopy, or “flame AA”.  Walsh was had recognized that current methods of emission spectroscopy were not sensitive enough.  As the story goes, he was working in his garden one Saturday when he conceived of the idea to measure absorption of light instead of emission.  He immediately phoned his colleague John Shelton, and they devised a plan to test the method on Monday.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look, John!, he exulted. We’ve been measuring the wrong bloody thing! We should be measuring absorption, not emission! [1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, Walsh recognized a need for a new method (a gap in or lack of analysis capabilities) and drew on his chemical knowledge to conceive of a solution.  In this case, he built upon the work of Robert Wilhelm Bunsen and Gustav Robert Kirchoff who had described the underlying principals in the late 1800s; Pierre Bouguer, Johann Heinrich Lambert, and August Beer, who had previously characterized the attenuation of light by absorbing species; and the scientists who developed the atomic emission instruments shortly before Walsh and his colleagues devised flame AA.</p>

<h2 id="establishment-of-capabilities">Establishment of Capabilities</h2>

<p>That Monday, Walsh and Shelton set up the simplest possible experiment using the element sodium and had obtained proof of concept before lunch.  Early on, the technique proved useful.  Walsh and his team used it to save the life of children in the hospital, prevent mercury poisoning in thousands of people, and discover vast mineral deposits in Australia. [1] As time progressed, the scientists were able to demonstrate the numerous capabilities of their technique, and fully characterized it’s applications and limitations.  At the same they continued to cycle through previous steps to further develop and refine the method.</p>

<h2 id="widespread-acceptance--continued-development">Widespread Acceptance &amp; Continued Development</h2>

<p>Initially, the scientific world was slow to accept flame AA.  However, flame AA is now used in a multitude of fields including chemistry, geology, medicine, agriculture, and metallurgy.  The current market value for flame AA is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year worldwide, and the indirect economic gains made possible by the ability to accurately, precisely, and routinely measure metals are innumerable.  The patents for flame AA expired in 1969, and many companies now manufacture flame AA instruments and have thoroughly engineered the spectrometers such that they’re robust and user-friendly.  Whereas the original instruments were complex arrangements on an optical table that required careful tweaking of this knob and that knob, modern instruments are nearly “plug-and-play”.</p>

<h2 id="death-of-method">Death of Method</h2>

<p>Although flame AA is still a widely used technique, the same cannot be said of all analytical methods.  For example, anyone wishing to conduct a nickel analysis today would default to an atomic absorption or atomic emission method for their sensitivity, reproducibility, and throughput compared to the gravimetric methods of yesteryear.  These methods have essentially died off, persisting in memory but rarely used.  As technology progresses and new methods are developed we find many (if not all) techniques eventually succumb to this fate.</p>

<h1 id="the-work-of-an-analytical-chemist">The Work of an Analytical Chemist</h1>

<p>To summarize, the process of developing a new analytical method involves several defined steps, each of which draws on various other fields.  In the example above, the investigators (1) conceived of a new method, drawing on their chemical expertise in the process.  They then (2) developed a proof of concept tests and refined their proof-of-concepts into a prototype instrument.  In doing so, they designed and engineered the hardware, built electrical circuits, assembled optical systems.  Modern analytical chemists usually write software to control the instrument and process the data as well.  After developing the instrument, the inventors set out to (3) establish its capabilities through repetitive testing to determine its detection limits, noise characteristics, calibration methods, etc., in the process employing the tools of statistical analysis and testing the instrument in many different scenarios.  Often, this step is a cycle of measuring the capabilities, making small improvement, and repeating.  Finally, they published their work as a journal article and patent and it eventually (4) became widely accepted and currently sees widespread use.  Now, (5) other researchers and even companies have refined the technique into a truly robust, commercialized instrument available to scientists in all fields, not just analytical chemistry.  This step usually involved small improvements over many years or decades (6) to yield the “mature” technique we have today.  And most techniques at some point fail to stay useful and are replaced by newer, more sensitive methods developed by future analytical chemists.</p>

<div class="image-caption-center"> Analytical chemistry draws on many fields.</div>

<p>Throughout this process of refinement, the analytical chemist routinely considers their <em>design requirements</em>.  Often, there is a tradeoff between characteristics in an instrument.  For example, you may design your instrument to be very sensitive, but sacrifice size and portability in the process.  A company commercializing the instrument will likely modify the technique into a very robust and user-friendly instrument, but may have to sacrifice some sensitivity in the process.  One way or another though, analytical chemists work at the <em>extremes of analysis</em>, pushing the bounds of detection limits, instrument size, or other instrument capabilities.  Through this, analytical chemistry opens up new chemical tools to scientists in all disciplines (and even outside of science – things like rain-sensing wipers are a results of analytical methods!).</p>

<div class="image-caption-center"> Analytical chemistry not only draws on many fields, but also gives to many fields.</div>

<p>To once again quote David Harvey in <em>Analytical Chemistry 2.1</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To an analytical chemist, the process of making a useful measurement is critical; if the measurement is not of central importance to the work, then it is not analytical chemistry.</p>

  <p>[We] will come across numerous examples of analytical methods…most of which are routine examples of chemical analysis. It is important to remember, however, that nonroutine problems prompted analytical chemists to develop these methods.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So overall, an analytical chemist’s work is to take nonroutine problems and make them routine.</p>
