    <p>Hey y’all, and welcome again to Instrumental Analysis!</p>

<p>So class officially starts with this video!  So this first week is really focused on laying out a common framework we can use to understand the subject matter of the class.  It may seem a bit slow as we get going.  We’re really easing into things, but I think it’s important to provide some context about the subject matter of this class because it’s a bit different than many chemistry classes.  We’ll talk about why that is over the next few videos, but I want to start by thinking about some of the problems we’re going to tackle in this class, or perhaps some of the problems you’ll be prepared to handle when you finish this class.</p>

<p>This class is divided up into 4 units: (1) Foundations, (2) Chromatography, (3) Spectroscopy, and (4) Spectrometry.</p>

<p>Chromatography is a type of separation science and something you’ve all done before (TLC, column).  It’s rarely used alone in Instrumental Analysis because it can’t really detect the sample, only separate it.  Most often we use it in conjunction with some sort of spectroscopic or mass spectrometric technique as a detector.</p>

<p>And that brings us to the other two units.  Spectroscopy is the study of how light interacts with matter.  Again, this is something you’ve all done before – remember FTIR, UV-visible spectroscopy, and NMR.</p>

<p>Finally, mass spectrometry uses electric fields to separate ions (either atoms or molecules) based on their mass.  We can use this information to determine either the identity of the atom or the structure of the molecule.</p>

<p>But why should we care about these techniques?</p>

<p>Let’s take an example from the news right now. So we’ve all probably been using a lot of this lately.  Of course, we’re in the midst of this global pandemic called COVID19 and caused by this coronavirus.  One way to limit the spread of the virus and protect yourself and protect others from getting sick it’s to use hand sanitizer.</p>

<p>And this stuff is some sort of alcohol either ethanol or isopropanol that importantly that has to be at a specific range of concentration so it’s about 60 to 70 percent depending on which one you’re using.  If it’s lower than that it won’t be effective and if it’s higher than that it won’t be effective. And so it’s important to get the formula right? Aside from that active ingredient of alcohol. There’s a number of other things in here from water to glycerin some fragrances some moisturizers and then some preservatives.</p>

<p>because there’s been such a demand for it manufactures basically haven’t been able to keep up. And so you’ve probably noticed if you’ve gone to the stores been really hard to find this stuff even if you go on like online and try and order it.</p>

<p>It’s really hard to find. And so a lot of people have gotten into the business of making hand sanitizer over the past six months. Some of them well-intentioned trying to really help provide a product to those who need it. But some of them are probably just trying to make money, right?</p>

<p>Some of them just just want to make the cheapest.Sanitizer possible that people will stop by. All right.So that’s one thing to keep in mind that there might be some sort of cheap knock-offs out there. All right. Another another thing to that, that’s.All right. So that’s just one thing to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Alright so another thing about the past six months is we’ve seen an uptick in methanol poisonings and you might ask what why are their methanol poisonings because of the the pandemic? Well, a lot of people think it’s probably because of this hand sanitizer. So methanol is not listed as an ingredient on here, but that doesn’t mean people aren’t either putting it in here to make it cheaper so purposefully adding methanol in here because it sort of dilutes the hand sanitizer and they’re able to stretch it a little farther.</p>

<p>Sell more of it.Or it’s getting in their inadvertently. People are somehow somehow it’s ending up in their inadvertently and people don’t realize it because maybe they don’t know exactly what they’re doing with hand sanit with making this stuff. All right. And so,</p>

<p>The FDA has actually started testing this for for two things. One is to make sure that they’re in this range of appropriate concentration for alcohol and two is to see if whether or not they have methanol in them. And that’s what we really that’s the question we can answer here in this class is.</p>

<p>Alright, and so we have two questions here. One is does this hand sanitizer contain an appropriate amount of alcohol? So does it have enough in there to be effective and does it have?An and also is there too much right? Because too much because.It also is there too much.</p>

<p>And the other question we have is.Is this.Does this contain methanol? So, of course methanol is harmful. It causes it can absorb through your skin because blindness and even death if you ingest enough of it. And so those are two questions and we can answer both of those questions with instrumental analysis.</p>

<p>And so by the end of the semester, you’d be well-qualified to figure this problem out. All right. And so,Let’s think about but let’s think about how we might answer this. So this has been a problem that’s been around for a long time. It’s not unique to this pandemic.</p>

<p>You probably have heard the word “proof” before in relation to alcohol.  For example, something that’s “40 proof” is 80% alcohol.  This actually comes from a technique called “proofing” the alcohol.  Basically, people buying alcohol long ago wanted to be sure they were getting alcohol that wasn’t watered down.  Because 40% alcohol and 80% alcohol look about the same.  So what they’d do is take a spoonful of the alcohol and light it on fire – if it burned it was “proof” that it wasn’t watered down.</p>

<p>So we could do the same thing with hand sanitizer.  If we try to light it on fire and it doesn’t burn it’s not concentrated enough.  So for a long time this was how we approached chemical analysis.  We used things we could directly observe with our five senses to describe a sample.  Obviously this has some limitations.</p>

<p>For example, what if I bought my alcohol from someone who had diluted it with something flammable other than ethanol?  So you may have heard of people going blind from drinking moonshine and this was why.  Some sellers would dilute their moonshine with methanol to make a little extra money.  It would still “proof” but unfortunately would either blind or kill the person who ingested it because methanol basically metabolizes to formaldehyde in your body and so is toxic.</p>

<p>So anyway, we have the same problem with hand sanitizers today.  Some people are perhaps adding methanol to make a little extra money, or maybe it’s ending up in there because the people making it don’t know what they’re doing.  Either way, we’ve seen an uptick in methanol poisoning and the FDA has started monitoring hand sanitzers for both methanol content and ethanol content.  Obviously the flame test isn’t sensitive enough to prove the hand sanitizer is safe or effective – we need something better.  And that’s where instrumental analysis comes in.  This is a field that relies on modern electronic or optical equipment to analyze samples, and can really accurately and precisely tell the about the chemical makeup of a sample.</p>

<p>So I haven’t been able to find confirmation of the technique that the FDA uses for this, but I suspect they’re using gas chromatography.  Specifically, they’re probably using GC-FID, because this is the standard method for determining alcohol content in glycerine.  Believe it or not there’s actually a standard method for doing that!</p>

<p>So this is one problem that depends on instrumental analysis for an answer.  But of course there are many more.  And if you only get one thing out of this class, I hope it’s the ability to choose an analytical method given a specific problem.</p>

<p>As another example, you book talks about cocaine.</p>

<p>Or you may consider the water issues that faced Flint, MI several years ago.</p>

<p>So there are a lot of problems that we can tackle with the subject matter of this class.  And your goal for the class is to learn what tools are available to you and how to choose the appropriate tool to use given a specific situation.  Aside from that the rest is learning how to use the tools well.</p>

<p>So that’s all for now.  See you in the next video!</p>
