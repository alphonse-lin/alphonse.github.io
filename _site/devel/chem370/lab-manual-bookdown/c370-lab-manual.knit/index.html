<h2 id="introduction-r-intro--">Introduction {#r-intro -}</h2>

<p>Chem 370 lab will make extensive use of electronic lab notebooks.  We’ll use two tools to achieve a robust electronic lab notebook: (1) <strong>R Markdown Notebooks</strong>, (2) the <strong>R</strong> programming language, and (3) the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwictpuN2IvqAhVtl3IEHUhSCUUQFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frstudio.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2mM_qCjo878d2q5bcC0XUS">RStudio</a> integrated development (IDE, a tool that will make it easier to use items 1 and 2).  The R Markdown (RMD) notebook provides a place to write everything that would normally go in your lab notebook, but is entirely electronic.  The R language is used to process data in a fashion similar to Excel, except that all actions are done by issuing commands rather than through a graphical interface.  Importantly, this configuration allows all of the data processing steps and data files you have in electronic form to be displayed directly in your lab notebook!  You’ll learn more about what these software are as you complete this lab activity.</p>

<p>The configuration described above requires the R language and the RStudio IDE.  These are both freely available online for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux.  You have several options when using the software: (1) You may install R and RStudio directly on your personal computer (recommended) or (2) use R and RStudio through WCU’s VCAT interface (might be useful as a backup if your computer isn’t cooperating).</p>

<p>Know up front that learning to program can be a daunting experience and takes time to learn.  You’ll experience many occasions in which your code won’t run, and you’ll have to figure out why.  This can be frustrating at times, and you may often feel lost.  But programming can also be very rewarding once you start to get the hang of it!  To help with your transition into the world of programmatic data analysis, you’ll be provided with several forms of tutorials.  Some will be built directly into RStudio, and you’ll be able to access them after installing the Chem 370 add-on package; others will be in the form of video tutorials in which I’ll walk you through various steps of installing the software, navigating it, and processing your data.</p>

<p>Your goals for this lab are to become familiar with the Markdown syntax, install R and R+Studio on your computer, and then create a lab notebook template using R Markdown that you’ll use to record details and data next week in lab (so make sure you bring your computer next week!).</p>

<h2 id="learning-markdown-learning-markdown--">Learning Markdown {#learning-markdown -}</h2>

<p><strong>Markdown</strong> is a markup language that was developed by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in the mid-2000’s.  It provides a simple, streamlined utility for word processing and web page creation.  It’s been adopted in many places, which numerous websites, message boards, blogs, and even all the materials for this course being written in Markdown.  In essence, the writer creates a plain text document (extension: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.md</code>) and uses software to render the Markdown into a nicely formatted document (originally just HTML (web format), but now there’s support for PDFs, Word Docs, and more).  The language is quite simple; if you can use Word, you can easily use Markdown.  The tutorial linked below will help you get started.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>TASK:</strong> Complete the <a href="https://www.markdowntutorial.com/">Markdown Tutorial</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="installing-r--rstudio-install-r--">Installing R + RStudio {#install-r -}</h2>

<p><strong>R</strong> is the programming language we’ll use to process data this semester.  We’ll discuss more of the details about what R is and why we’re using it in a few weeks.  For now we just need to get it installed and create a basic Markdown document.  <strong>RStudio</strong> is a peice of software called an <em>integrated development environment</em> (IDE) that provides a unified interface for all the tools we need to use R.  It is <strong><em>highly</em></strong> recommended that you use RStudio to interact with R.  The steps below will walk you through installing both of them.</p>

<h3 id="install-r-must-be-done-first--">Install R (Must be done first) {-}</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open a web browswer and navigate to the <a href="http://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/">Duke University R Mirror</a> and click the link for your operating system (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux).</li>
  <li>Follow the on-screen prompts to install R (will vary by operating system).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="install-rstudio--">Install RStudio {-}</h3>

<ol>
  <li><em>Once you’ve successfully installed R</em>, navigate to the <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio downloads page</a> and click the link to download the version that matches your operating system.</li>
  <li>Follow the on-screen prompts to install RStudio (will vary by operating system).</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="installing-the-chem-370-package-installing-c370-package--">Installing the CHEM 370 Package {#installing-c370-package -}</h3>

<p>One of the great things about R is that anyone can develop add-ons (called “packages”) for it.  I’ve developed a package for Chem 370 that has functions and tutorials specifically for this class.  You’ll need to install it to follow along with the tutorials.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Once you’ve installed R and RStudio, you open up RStudio (opening RStudio also opens an R session automatically).</li>
  <li>Install the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">devtools</code> package, which will make it easier to install the Chem 370 package.
    <ol>
      <li>In RStduio, navigate to the <strong>Packages</strong> tab in the lower right pane and click <strong>Install</strong>.</li>
      <li>In the dialog that opens, type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">devtools</code> on the <em>Packages</em> line.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Install</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Install the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chem370learnR</code> package</em>: In Rstudio, find the <strong>Console</strong> tab in the lower left pane.  Copy and paste the following lines <em>exactly</em>:</p>

    <div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="w">   </span><span class="n">using</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">devtools</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
   </span><span class="n">install_github</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"github URL for package"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chem370learnR</code> package should now be installed on your system.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-lab-notebook-project-create-lab-notebook--">Creating a Lab Notebook Project {#create-lab-notebook -}</h2>

<h3 id="create-a-project--">Create a Project {-}</h3>

<p>In this step, you’ll create an R “project” for lab 1.  The project will help keep all your files for lab 1 organized.  You should create a separate project for each lab.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In RStudio, click the <strong>Project: (none)</strong> button in the top corner and then click <em>*New Project…</em></li>
  <li>Choose <strong>New Directory</strong> and <strong>New Project</strong>.</li>
  <li>Type in <strong>Lab 1: UV-vis</strong> in the <em>Directory name</em> line.  In the <em>Create project as subdirectory of:</em> box choose <strong>Browse</strong>.  Then:
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Documents</code> folder (or another directory if you prefer to save your notebooks somewhere else).</li>
      <li>Create a <strong>New Directory</strong>/<strong>New Folder</strong> and call in <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lab-notebooks</code></strong>.</li>
      <li>Click OK to exit the dialog.  The path should be set to something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/Documents/lab-notebooks</code> (may vary slightly depending on your OS).</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Click <strong>Create Project</strong>.  You’ll see that project icon in the top right corner now read <strong>Project: Lab 1: UV-vis</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="create-a-notebook-file--">Create a Notebook File {-}</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Load the Chem 370 learnR package: Go to the <strong>Packages</strong> tab in the bottom right pane and check <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chem370learnR</code> on.  You should load this package everytime you start R.</li>
  <li>In the top left corner, click the <strong>New File</strong> icon and choose <strong>R Markdown</strong>.</li>
  <li>In the new window that opens, choose <strong>From Template</strong> (left side) and then <strong>Chem 370 Lab Notebook</strong>. Enter <strong><em>lab1_uv-vis</em></strong> for the title (i.e. filename) and your name for the author.  Make sure the output is set to HTML and click <strong>OK</strong>.  Use this format for all your lab notebooks this semester.</li>
  <li>The notebook document is populated with a bare bones template for use in lab.  Fill in a title and your name, and write and introduction before lab next week.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="overview--">Overview {-}</h1>

<p>This course is an introduction to instrumental analysis in the chemistry lab. Students will be introduced to components of the “analyst’s toolbox” through real-world scenarios, including spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and chromatography. Students will conduct sample preparation, instrument calibration, and qualitative and quantitative analysis using UV-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HP-LC), flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Throughout the semester, students will also work to develop skills related to reproducible data analysis, scientific communication, and collaboration in the laboratory. Prerequisites include CHEM-232 (Quantitative Analysis) and CHEM-242 (Organic Chemistry II).</p>

<h2 id="lab-activities--">Lab Activities {-}</h2>

<p>Students will work in pairs at the beginning of the semester to complete introductory labs involving spectroscopy and gas chromatography.  After that, they will be assigned groups of 2-3 with which they will complete one rotation lab that lasts the remainder of the semester.  Students may choose to analyze <a href="/devel/chem370/lab-manual/rotation-a-e-cigarette-liquid.html">e-cigarette liquid</a> or <a href="/devel/chem370/lab-manual/rotation-b-acetaminophen.html">acetaminophen tablets</a> for their rotation lab.  The rotation lab are scenario-based, so students should refer to the memorandum at the beginning of each rotation for details.  The lab activities for the rotation lab are:</p>

    <tr>
      <th>Vape Juice</th>
      <th>Acetaminophen</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>GC-MS (ID flavor)</td>
      <td>HPLC (Quantify acetaminophen, check purity)</td>

      <td>HPLC (Quantify Nicotine, check purity)</td>
      <td>AA (Quantify Metal)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="lab-notebooks--">Lab Notebooks {-}</h2>

<p>Students will use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Lab</a> as an electronic lab notebook together with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave (or MATLAB)</a> for data processing.  Octave is an open-source programming language that is largely modeled after MATLAB, one of the most commonly used programming languages in the fields of chemistry, physics, and engineering.  In general, MATLAB code will usually run in Octave.  So if you get stuck in Octave, you can usually find MATLAB examples that will help solve your problem.  More information on these software packages can be found in the <a href="/devel/chem370/lab-manual/appendix-1-getting-started-in-octave-and-jupyter-lab.html">appendices</a>.</p>

<h2 id="features-of-the-book--">Features of the Book {-}</h2>

<h3 id="typographical-conventions--"><strong>Typographical Conventions</strong> {-}</h3>

<p>This lab manual will use some common typographical (formatting) conventions to distinguish between its different features.   For example, the data processing activities will make extensive use of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">Octave (MATLAB)</a> code, which will always be represented with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">monospace font with a grey background</code> (in the online version).  It may be <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inline</code> or</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>offset.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should take time to thoroughly digest code chunks.  Sometimes the code may work as-is; other times you may have to add to the code or change placeholders to make it work.  And other times the code may be <em>pseudocode</em>, which is example code that looks like it would work but will throw an error.  The code will often be color-coded to highlight various features of the programming language (a feature called syntax highlighting).</p>

<p>The lab procedures will often contain warnings that your should watch out for.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A warning will look like this!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also contains checkpoints and tips to help keep you on track.<br />
\begin{marginfigure}
A tip or checkpoint will look like this.
\end{marginfigure}</p>

<!-- Both in code and in the lab manual text, capital letters will be used to represent matrices and lowercase letters will be used to represent vectors and scalars.  Matrices and vectors will always be bold within the text.  For example:

- `A` or **A** represents a matrix
- `a` or **a** represents a vector
- `a` or $a$ represents a scalar. -->

<h3 id="e-book-vs-pdf--"><strong>e-Book vs. PDF</strong> {-}</h3>

<p>This lab manual is available in both HTML (webpage) format and as a PDF.  These two formats generally have identical content, although some features of the book (such as videos) may only work in the online version and do not appear in the PDF.</p>

<h3 id="course-policies--">Course Policies {-}</h3>

<p><strong>Classroom Expectations:</strong> The shared learning space of the college classroom is built on respect for each other and each other’s learning. Learning together means our actions can intentionally and unintentionally distract others from their learning goals. As responsible learners who respect the rights of others and vow to minimize avoidable distractions such as: non-academic technology use, coming in late, sleeping, off-topic discussions, doing other homework, eating, etc.</p>

<p><strong><em>Proper Laboratory Attire:</em></strong> Students must arrive to lab wearing appropriate attire.  Students without appropriate attire will be asked to leave and will not be able to complete the activity for the day (and will be counted absent).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wear eye protection at all times (whenever you are in the room).</li>
  <li>Wear closed-toed shoes that fully cover your feet up to the ankle at all times.</li>
  <li>Wear long pants that extend over the top of your shoes at all times.</li>
  <li>Wear a hair tie for long hair.</li>
  <li>Never wear tank tops, sleeveless shirts, shorts, or sandals.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Laboratory Behavior:</em></strong> Never bring food or drink into the laboratory.  This includes sealed bottles and items inside backpacks – leave them outside the lab!  Do not chew gum, use tobacco products, or apply cosmetics in the lab.  Do not place personal items inside fume hoods or where they may come into contact with chemicals.  Keep walkways clear of chairs, bookbags, etc.  Wash your hands before leaving lab, and never wear gloves or lab coats outside the lab!</p>

<p>The sparing use of cell phones during lab sessions is permitted but discouraged. If you must, please use your cell phone outside the laboratory, and never leave an experiment unattended to do so!</p>

<p>In an effort to maintain a productive work environment for all students, please refrain from playing music, videos, etc., in the classroom.</p>

<p><strong><em>Pregnancy:</em></strong> Certain chemicals can have severe harmful effects on unborn children.  Any student who is pregnant or might have become pregnant and wished to avoid these hazards should notify her TA or instructor before conducting any laboratory work so that proper safety precautions can be taken.</p>

<p><strong>Attendance:</strong> Please email your instructor <em>ahead of time</em> if you encounter circumstances that absolutely prevent you from making it to lab on time.  Attendance to all class periods is mandatory. Absences from group work sessions may incur a loss of points up to a zero for the assignment and deductions in the student’s participation grade.</p>

<p><strong>Inclement Weather:</strong> Please check the University website for campus closings during times of bad weather.  Your safety is a priority when traveling. Use common sense when attempting to get to campus and notify your instructor if you are unable to safely make it.  Announcements will be made via e-mail if class must be cancelled when the University has not officially closed.</p>

<p><strong>Composition-Condition Marks:</strong> Proper mastery of the English language will be considered when assessing written work. A student whose written work fails to meet acceptable standards will be assigned a composition-condition (CC) mark by the instructor on the final grade report. All undergraduates who receive two CC grades prior to the semester in which they complete 110 hours at WCU are so notified by the registrar and are required to pass English 300 or English 401 before they will be eligible for graduation. This course must be taken within two semesters of receiving the second CC and must be passed with a grade of C (2.0) or better. Students needing assistance with writing are encouraged to get help from WaLC. All written work submitted for this class may be checked with SafeAssign.</p>

<p><strong>Civil Discourse at Western Carolina:</strong> Consistent with WCU’s core values and our campus creed, the WCU community accepts the freedoms and responsibilities of our shared community. WCU encourages all to clearly express their own views while at the same time seeking to understand the varieties of style, identity, and opinion that are held in any diverse community. In order for us to sustain a learning environment that promotes and values freedom of expression, we have a shared charge to accept personal responsibility for our actions, reactions, and speech, while seeking to learn from the actions, reactions, and speech of others.</p>

<!-- Proper Laboratory Attire: Students must arrive to lab wearing appropriate attire. Students without appropriate attire will be asked to leave and will not be able to complete the activity for the day (and will be counted absent). Students who forget their goggles may “rent” a pair for a cost of 5 points subtracted from their grade.

- Wear goggles at all times (whenever you are in the room).
- Wear closed-toed shoes that fully cover your feet up to the ankle at all times.
- Wear long pants that extend over the top of your shoes at all times.
- Wear a hair tie for long hair.

<p>This lab will use Vernier SpectroVis UV-visible/fluorescence spectrometers to quantify the amount of quinine in tonic water.  You will be given a sample of store-bought tonic water and a concentrated stock solution of quinine.  You will then dilute the stock solution to create a standard curve and measure the concentration of quinine in solution and use quality-control sample of known concentration to test the accuracy of your curve.  This lab will compare results between absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy.  Samples and the QC will be measured in triplicate so that you can get a mean and standard deviation for your measurement, and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) will be determined from a blank sample.</p>

<p>Students should work in pairs for the lab activity and turn in independent data analysis sheets and lab notebooks.</p>

<h2 id="uv-vis-procedure">Lab Procedure</h2>

<h3 id="prepare-your-standards">Prepare Your Standards</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create your standards by diluting one of the 100-ppm quinine stock solutions to concentrations of approximately 100, 75, 40, 20, and 10 ppm using the technique of serial dilution.  Use 25 mL volumetric flasks for these dilutions.</p>

    <p>\begin{marginfigure}
 It doesn’t matter if you make these concentrations \emph{exactly}, what
 matters is that you’re in the right ballpark and \emph{know} your
 concentrations exactly.
 \end{marginfigure}</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a quality control sample from a separate stock solution.  Make it roughly 20 ppm.  Use a 50 mL volumetric flask.</p>

    <p>\begin{marginfigure}
 When creating your QC, make sure you use stock solution from a different
 lot and preferrably a different manufacturer. This helps check for
 contamination in the chemicals received from the supplier. You should
 also do your QC calculations entirely from scratch so that you check
 your math with the QC.
 \end{marginfigure}</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="prepare-your-samples">Prepare Your Samples</h3>

<ol>
  <li>There is no sample preparation – run all samples undiluted.</li>

<p>You will be given mixture of unknown composition for this lab.  It will contain several organic compounds with <em>similar boiling points</em>.  You goals are to (1) determine how many components there are in the mixture, (2) determine the percent composition for each compound, and (3) determine the relative polarities of the compounds.</p>

<p>To complete these tasks you will use a gas chromatograph.  Specifically, you will use Gow-Mac 150-series and 400-series isothermal gas chromatographs with thermal conductivity detectors (GC-TCD).  These instruments separate compounds by both boiling point and polarity, and produce a peak for each component wherein the peak area is proportional to the amount of that component present.</p>

<p>Before coming to lab you should be familiar with the concepts presented in the following videos:</p>

<h3 id="load-the-syringe">Load the Syringe</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Obtain a microliter syringe and clean it with acetone in the syringe cleaning apparatus:
    <ol>
      <li>Place the syringe in the funnel on top of the apparatus.</li>
      <li>Turn on the vacuum pump with the <strong>black on/off switch</strong>.</li>
      <li>Squirt solvent through the syringe.</li>
      <li>Clean the plunger and the needle with a Kimwipe moistened with your solvent.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>For a solvent blank:  Pull about 4 $\mu$L acetone into the syringe.</li>
  <li>For a samples:
    <ol>
      <li>Pull 4 $\mu$L of your sample into the syringe.</li>
      <li>Pull air into the syringe until you can clearly see how much sample you loaded.  Record this value in your lab notebook.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="inject-the-sample">Inject the Sample</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure the software is running and the instrument is ready to run. (It should be if you completed the steps above and the baseline is stable.)</li>
  <li>
    <p>Push the syringe through the septum of the <strong>side B</strong> injection port and then depress the plunger.  Do this step as smoothly and quickly as possible, and be consistent.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The syringe plunger does not go all the way down to the glass body!  Do not force it or you will ruin the syringe!</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Press the start button in the software.  Again, the key is to be consistent with when you press the start button relative to sample injection!</li>
  <li>Allow the instrument to run for at least 5 minutes for all peaks to elute.</li>
  <li>Immediately clean the syringe in the syringe cleaning apparatus, and then repeat the loading and injection steps as needed for all blanks/samples.  Make sure you clean the syringe after the last sample.</li>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that an outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, associated lung injury (EVALI) began in June 2019.  It continues today, and will continue until a culprit is found.  As of December 17, 2019 a total of <strong>2,506 EVALI hospitalizations</strong> from 50 states, the District of Columbia, and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands), and <strong>54 EVALI deaths</strong> from 27 US states have been reported to CDC. Studies have found vitamin E acetate, plant and vegetable oils, petroleum distillates, and terpenes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of many affected individuals. [1]  The figure below shows some common chemical exposures from e-cigarettes.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/img/e-cigarette-cdc.jpg" alt="Common exposure pathways related to e-cigarettes.  Public domain image from [CDC Stacks](https://stacks.cdc.gov/gsearch?collection=&amp;terms=CS292347-A)." /></p>

<p>The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) is seeking our help in finding the cause of the outbreak in NC. (See <a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/nc-health-officials-report-3-cases-of-severe-lung-disease-after-vaping">this WLOS story</a> for additional information.) We are asked to screen e-cigarette liquid for toxicants.</p>

<p>Please turn in a technical report detailing the findings of your analyses.  Your report should link together the results from all your analyses, use complementary results to bolster your conclusions, and discuss what implications the findings from each analysis have on human health.</p>

<h5 id="sample-information--"><strong>Sample Information:</strong> {-}</h5>

<p>NCDHHS asked EVALI patients which types of of vaping liquids they used.  NCDHHS acquired these products and sent them to Western Analytics for characterization.  Aliquots of two samples will be randomly assigned to your workgroup for analysis.  Some samples are regulated off-the-shelf e-cigarette liquid and some may be home-made or “black-market” samples.  You may find problems with one, both, or none of your samples.  You will also be given a toxicant-free reference sample.  Although samples are over-the-counter products, they are all presumed toxic; you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin.</p>

<h5 id="record-keeping---"><strong>Record Keeping:</strong>  {-}</h5>

<p>Due to the high-impact nature of this work, you must diligently keep track of all sample information (e.g. samples names) and data.  You must also follow our standard quality-control and data-validation practices to ensure your results are accurate.  Likewise, all results must meet the precision guidelines described in the procedure for each instrument.</p>

<h5 id="keep-in-mind----"><em>Keep in mind:</em>   {-}</h5>

<ul>
  <li>There are no additional samples available – plan ahead to make sure you don’t use up all your sample!</li>
  <li>The lot number for each sample (provided on the bag/vial) must be explicitly tracked in your lab notebook and final report.</li>
  <li>You must provide me with your data files and lab notebooks (in addition to your report) for validation.</li>
  <li>You must get certified on each instrument prior to using it.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is of utmost importance.  The sooner the culprit(s) is (are) found, the sooner we can help get dangerous products off the shelf, and the more lives we can save!</p>

<h2 id="gc-ms">GC-MS</h2>

<p>Gas chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures of gases.  The gases are injected into a column, which (in our case) is a long, hollow tube with a non-polar liquid coating on the inside.  They are pushed through the column with a carrier gas, He in our instrument.  The column is initially held at low temperature (a little above room temperature) and ramped at a defined rate up to 250 degrees C.  The combination of the temperature ramp and the non-polar column allows compounds to be separated based on boiling point and polarity.  GC can be paired with many different techniques, and is often used with electron-ionization mass spectrometry.  This type of mass spectrometer breaks molecules apart into fragments, sorts the fragments by mass, and counts the number of fragments of each mass.  The specific spectrum (or distribution of fragments) is unique for every chemical compound and is based on the stability of each bond in the molecule.  In this way, the identity of a compound can usually be deduced from a mass spectrum alone, although techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy can greatly aid in identification.</p>

<p>You will conduct liquid phase microextraction to analyze the volatile constituents of e-cigarette liquid.  You should identify the major flavor constituents and comment on whether or not they may be harmful at the approximate levels present.</p>

<p>The general order for GC-MS sampling is: (1) run solvent blanks on the GC-MS until the instrument is clean,  (2) prepare a single sample using liquid-phase microextraction, (3) run the sample, and (4) repeat 2-4 as necessary.  You should obtain a clean blank before preparing your samples.  For GC-MS, a passing blank will have a baseline less than 50,000 counts that is stable and peak-free.  You may see an increase in the baseline at temperature above 250$^{\circ}$C; this is normal and still considered passing.  If the blank is dirty you will not be able to tell what is from your sample and what is contamination!</p>

<p>This is a qualitative analysis.</p>

<h2 id="flame-aa">Flame AA</h2>

<p>Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy is a common method of determining the concentration of specific metals (cations) in a sample.  A solution is nebulized (aerosolized) into an acetylene flame where it is atomized (broken apart into its constituent atoms).  The atoms in the flame absorb characteristic wavelengths of light, unique to each element.  A light source specific to the analyte of interest (specifically, a hollow cathode lamp) shines through the flame, where the light gets absorbed by the sample.  The amount of absorption absorbed is linearly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in solution.  Although the instrument is relatively robust and inexpensive, it is limited to probing for a single analyte at a time.</p>

<p>The general procedure for this lab is to: (1) vape a sample and collect the aerosol, (2) prepare standards, blanks, and QCs, (3) run the standards, blank, and QC, and (4) run the samples.</p>

<p>For flame AA, the definitions of “passing” are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Blank:</strong> Flat, smooth baseline showing only random noise and/or instrument drift no greater than a few percent over 10-15 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Standard Curve:</strong> A linear line with $R^2 \ge 0.9990$.</li>
  <li><strong>QC:</strong> A measured concentration within 5% ($\pm$ 5%) of the known concentration.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a quantitative analysis.</p>

<h2 id="ft-ir">FT-IR</h2>

<p>FT-IR spectroscopy is used to deduce the bonds present in liquids, solids, and gases.  It is widely used in industry, research, and teaching for qualitative analysis, but can also provide very accurate quantitative information.  All molecules have a unique infrared spectrum, comparable to a person’s fingerprint.  However, it is usually very difficult to interpret infrared spectra of mixtures.  Chemometrics and linear algebra can circumvent this issue by picking out minute differences between spectra using statistical methods.  During this lab, FT-IR will be used to match a sample of e-cigarette liquid to a reference spectrum using a metric called the hit quality index (HQI).  This methods provides a measure of how well two spectra match, and a HQI of 0.99 or better is required to indicate a contaminant-free sample.</p>

<p>This lab will use the Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer) to determine whether samples of Tylenol (acetaminophen) are pure.  The Spectrum One is in NS 226.  Before lab, read <em>Standardization of Raman Spectra for Transfer of Spectral Libraries Across Different Instruments</em>.  Focus on the paragraph regarding hit-quality index calculation.</p>

<p>The general order for FT-IR sampling is: (1) collect a background (no sample present) and (2) collect sample spectra by placing a drop of sample on the instrument.  You will collect 3 spectra for each sample and 3 spectra of the reference sample.</p>

<h3 id="safety---3">Safety {-}</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This lab will require the use of small amounts of <a href="http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927062">acetone</a>; avoid contact with skin and eyes.</li>
  <li>Although samples are over-the-counter products, you should avoid ingesting and/or contacting them with your skin.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="instrumentation-1">Instrumentation</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Use the CHEM370 user on the FTIR.  Make sure you are collecting spectra as <em>Absorbance</em> vs. <em>Wavenumber</em>.</li>
  <li>Record a background spectrum on the FT-IR according to the FT-IR SOP.</li>
  <li>Place 1 drop the sample on the ATR window and acquire a spectrum. You do not need the anvil for liquid samples.</li>
  <li>Wet a Kimwipe with a small amount of acetone and clean the ATR cell with it.</li>
  <li>Repeat the above steps 2 more times, for a total of three spectra for your sample.</li>
  <li>Repeat the above steps for each sample, so you end up with three spectra of each sample.</li>
  <li>Make sure you leave the instrument and your work area clean, and log out of the computer.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="waste-disposal-and-cleanup-2">Waste Disposal and Cleanup</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clean the IR with acetone and replace the cover.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Never spray acetone directly on the IR – always spray it on a Kimwipe pointed away from the instrument.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Brush up any acetaminophen powder on and around the IR.</li>
  <li>Use a minimal amount of warm water to rinse any powdered acetaminophen into the bottle labelled “Hazardous Waste: Lab 2 Acetaminophen” that is stored under the sample prep hood in the Instrument Lab.</li>
  <li>Make sure your work area and the instrument are cleaner than you found them.</li>

<h2 id="hplc">HPLC</h2>

<p>This lab will use the Agilent 1220 HPLC (high performance liquid chromatograph) to determine the concentration of nicotine in vaping liquid.</p>

<p>HPLC is a separation method.  Like all chromatographic methods, it employs a mobile phase and a stationary phase.  An analyte dissolved in solution is injected onto a column (the stationary phase) and carried through the column by a solvent, called the eluent or mobile phase.  The column is packed with a substrate, which – for reverse-phase HPLC as we’ll perform here – is a non-polar substance with a C<sub>18</sub> coating.  In the column, the sample partitions between the stationary and the mobile phase, and it’s relative affinity for each determines how quickly it moves through the column.  In this way, HPLC allows us to separate analytes based on polarity.  In this lab, you’ll use the HPLC to perform quantitative analysis.  This is possible because the area under each chromatographic peak is proportional to the concentration of each analyte.</p>

<p>The general order for HPLC sample preparation is: (1) Prepare standard and quality control samples (QCs), (2) run standards and a QC, (3) prepare the samples, and (4) run the samples.  You should obtain a clean blank, a passing standard curve, and a passing QC before preparing your samples.  If any of these fails there is no point in running your samples!</p>

<p>For HPLC, the definitions of “passing” are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Blank:</strong> Flat, smooth baseline showing only random noise and/or instrument drift no greater than a few percent over 15 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Standard Curve:</strong> A linear line with $R^2 \ge 0.9900$.</li>
  <li><strong>QC:</strong> A measured concentration within 5% ($\pm$ 5%) of the known concentration.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a quantitative analysis.</p>

<p>A confidential manufacturer of pharmaceuticals has recently received complaints of hospitalizations related to their generic-brand, child-strength, chewable acetaminophen (“Tylenol”).  The following symptoms have been observed in the patients (1) high acetaminophen concentration in the blood, (2) high zinc concentration in the blood, and (3) high concentrations of an unidentified organic compound in the blood, thought to be either caffeine or a flavoring compound.  The customer is unsure what the contaminant is or which production facility the bad product(s) came from.  They have halted manufacturing of the drug until the problem can be tracked down, and have sent samples to Western Analytics for analysis.</p>

<h2 id="ft-ir-1">FT-IR</h2>

<p>FT-IR spectroscopy is used to deduce the bonds present in liquids, solids, and gases.  It is widely used in industry, research, and teaching for qualitative analysis, but can also provide very accurate quantitative information.  All molecules have a unique infrared spectrum, comparable to a person’s fingerprint.  However, it is usually very difficult to interpret infrared spectra of mixtures.  Chemometrics and linear algebra can circumvent this issue by picking out minute differences between spectra using statistical methods.  During this lab, FT-IR will be used to match a sample of acetaminophen to a reference spectrum using a metric called the hit quality index (HQI).  This methods provides a measure of how well two spectra match, and a HQI of 0.99 or better is required to indicate a contaminant-free sample.</p>

<p>This lab will use the Perkin Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR (Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer) to determine whether samples of Tylenol (acetaminophen) are pure.  The Spectrum One is in NS 226.  Before lab, read <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51602215_Standardization_of_Raman_spectra_for_transfer_of_spectral_libraries_across_different_instruments"><em>Standardization of Raman Spectra for Transfer of Spectral Libraries Across Different Instruments</em>.</a>  Focus on the paragraph regarding hit-quality index calculation.</p>

<p>The general order for FT-IR sampling is: (1) collect a background (no sample present) and (2) collect sample spectra by placing a drop of sample on the instrument.  You will collect 3 spectra for each sample and 3 spectra of the reference sample.</p>

<h2 id="gc-ms-1">GC-MS</h2>

<p>Gas chromatography is a technique used to separate mixtures of gases.  The gases are injected into a column, which (in our case) is a long, hollow tube with a non-polar liquid coating on the inside.  They are pushed through the column with a carrier gas, He in our instrument.  The column is initially held at low temperature (a little above room temperature) and ramped at a defined rate up to 250 degrees C.  The combination of the temperature ramp and the non-polar column allows compounds to be separated based on boiling point and polarity.  GC can be paired with many different techniques, and is often used with electron-ionization mass spectrometry.  This type of mass spectrometer breaks molecules apart into fragments, sorts the fragments by mass, and counts the number of fragments of each mass.  The specific spectrum (or distribution of fragments) is unique for every chemical compound and is based on the stability of each bond in the molecule.  In this way, the identity of a compound can usually be deduced from a mass spectrum alone, although techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy can greatly aid in identification.</p>

<p>You will conduct liquid phase microextraction to analyze the volatile constituents of children’s chewable acetaminophen.  You should identify the major flavor constituents and comment on whether or not they may be harmful at the approximate levels present.</p>

<p>The general order for GC-MS sampling is: (1) run solvent blanks on the GC-MS until the instrument is clean,  (2) prepare a single sample using liquid-phase microextraction, (3) run the sample, and (4) repeat 2-4 as necessary.  You should obtain a clean blank before preparing your samples.  For GC-MS, a passing blank will have a baseline less than 50,000 counts that is stable and peak-free.  You may see an increase in the baseline at temperature above 250$^{\circ}$C; this is normal and still considered passing.  If the blank is dirty you will not be able to tell what is from your sample and what is contamination!</p>

<p>This is a qualitative analysis.</p>

<h2 id="flame-aa-1">Flame AA</h2>

<p>Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy is a common method of determining the concentration of specific metals (cations) in a sample.  A solution is nebulized (aerosolized) into an acetylene flame where it is atomized (broken apart into its constituent atoms).  The atoms in the flame absorb characteristic wavelengths of light, unique to each element.  A light source specific to the analyte of interest (specifically, a hollow cathode lamp) shines through the flame, where the light gets absorbed by the sample.  The amount of absorption absorbed is linearly proportional to the concentration of the analyte in solution.  Although the instrument is relatively robust and inexpensive, it is limited to probing for a single analyte at a time.</p>

<p>The general procedure for this lab is to: (1) grind and dissolve a sample of acetaminophen, (2) prepare standards, blanks, and QCs, (3) run the standards, blank, and QC, and (4) run the samples.</p>

<p>For flame AA, the definitions of “passing” are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Blank:</strong> Flat, smooth baseline showing only random noise and/or instrument drift no greater than a few percent over 15 minutes.</li>
  <li><strong>Standard Curve:</strong> A linear line with $R^2 \ge 0.9990$.</li>
  <li><strong>QC:</strong> A measured concentration within 5% ($\pm$ 5%) of the known concentration.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a quantitative analysis.</p>

<p>This appendix contains snippets of code you can use to accomplish specific tasks in Octave.  For the most part, you can copy and past this code and change the variable names to perform the tasks listed.  Most of the programming tasks you’ll need to accomplish in Chem 370 can be found here.</p>

<p>Some of the code is in the form of <em>functions</em>.  The code for each function should be run once in your notebook, after which point you can use that function just like any built-in Octave function.</p>

<h2 id="chromatogram--mass-spectrum-plotting--">Chromatogram &amp; Mass Spectrum Plotting {-}</h2>

<p>Chromatograms and mass spectra are often normalized to the maximum value in the chromatogram to give a $y$-axis in <em>Relative Abundance</em>, either as a fraction (0-1) or percentage (0-100%).  The following example assumes a data matrix with <em>Time</em> as column 1 and <em>Detector Signal</em> as column 2.</p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">### add a new column (3) that is the detector signal divided by the maximum detector signal.
chromatogram(:, 3) = chromatogram(:, 2) ./ max(chromatogram(:, 2)) * 100;
</code></pre>

<p>For chromatograms, it may sometimes be desirable to baseline correct the data first, as in:</p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">### add a new column (3) that is baseline corrected
chromatogram(:, 3) = chromatogram(:, 2) .- min(chromatogram(:, 2));
### normalize the baseline-corrected data and convert to percentage
chromatogram(:, 3) = chromatogram(:, 3) ./ max(chromatogram(:, 3)) * 100;
</code></pre>

<p>For mass spectra, data are mostly commonly plotted as bar plots instead of line plots.  This is because the the ions effectively have discrete, integer masses.  The example below assumes you have a data matrix called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">massSpectrum</code> with $m/z$ in column 1 and detector signal in column 2.</p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">### convert to relative abundance
massSpectrum = massSpectrum(:, 3) ./ max(massSpectrum(:, 3)) * 100;

### plot as bar plot
bar(massSpectrum(:, 1), massSpectrum(:, 3));

<h2 id="ir-spectrum-processing--">IR Spectrum Processing {-}</h2>

<p>IR spectra will be collected as <em>Absorbance</em> vs. <em>Frequency (in wavenumbers)</em>.   You will use this to calculate the hit-quality index (HQI) of each spectrum compared to a reference sample.  Read <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51602215_Standardization_of_Raman_spectra_for_transfer_of_spectral_libraries_across_different_instruments">Rodriguez et al 2011</a> for more information on HQI.</p>

<p>The examples below assume <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code> is defined as a spectrum containing <em>wavenumber</em> as the first column and <em>absorbance</em> and the second column.</p>

<h3 id="pre-processing--">Pre-processing {-}</h3>

<p>Often, IR spectra are normalized for comparison to each other.  This is done by baseline correcting the spectra so that the minimum value is zero (i.e. subtracting the minimum value in the spectrum) and setting the maximum value of each spectrum to 1 (i.e. dividing by the maximum value).  This approach is shown below.  An alternative approach is <em>mean centering</em>, which is not shown here.</p>

<p>You should show your normalized data when comparing spectra in your lab notebooks or reports (at least for Chem 370 lab).</p>

<p><strong>Baseline the data:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">X(:, 3) = X(:, 2) .- min(X(:, 2));  # subtract minimum abs. from all abs. values a new column
### Do this for all 3 of your spectra

<p><strong>Normalize the data to 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">X(:, 3) = X(:, 3) ./ max(X(:, 3));  # divide all baselined abs. values by max abs. value
### Do this for all 3 of your spectra
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Take the mean of 3 spectra:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">### Put your three spectra in a 3-column matrix
sample_A = [X(:, 2) X_2(:,2) X_3(:, 2)];

### Then, take the mean across rows
sample_A = mean(sample_A, [, 2]) # you could use [, 1] to take mean of columns

### Do this for both samples and the reference
</code></pre>

<h3 id="hit-quality-index-calculation--">Hit-quality Index Calculation {-}</h3>

<p>The hit-quality index is defined as:</p>

\[HQI = \frac{(\text{Reference} \cdot \text{Sample})^2}{(\text{Reference} \cdot \text{Reference}) \times (\text{Sample} \cdot \text{Sample})}\]

<p>Note that the dot is the <em>dot product</em>, NOT multiplication!  The dot product is easily calculated in Octave with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dot()</code> function.  The example below assumes you have created a matrix with the normalize absorbance in column 3 as per the examples above.</p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">dot(Ref(:, 3), X(:, 3))^2 / (dot(Ref(:, 3), Ref(:, 3)) * dot(X(:, 3), X(:, 3)))
### do this for both samples
</code></pre>

<p>This produces a single value that should be less than 1.  If your answer does not meet these criteria try the calculation again.</p>

<h3 id="plotting-ir-spectra--">Plotting IR Spectra {-}</h3>

<p>You should always plot your normalized data when comparing spectra in your lab notebooks or reports (at least for Chem 370 lab).</p>

<p>Note that (according to IUPAC convention) spectra are always plotted with higher energy on the left and lower energy on the right side of the $x$-axis.  For IR spectra displayed with frequency as $x$, this means you have to reverse the axis to be in reverse order, such that it go from higher frequency (higher energy, smaller wavelength) to lower frequency (lower energy, longer wavelength).</p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">plot(X(:, 1), sample_A);
set ( gca, 'xdir', 'reverse' ); #### This reverses the axis
xlim([600 4000]); ylim([0 1]);  # This sets the axis limits
xlabel("Frequency (cm^{-1})")   # Note that you can add superscripts and subscripts to labels!
ylabel("Normalized Absorbance")
hold on
plot(X_2(:, 1), sample_B);
plot(Ref(:, 1), Ref(:, 3));
hold off

### Make sure you include a legend too!

<h1 id="appendix-3-statistical-data-analysis--">Appendix 3: Statistical Data Analysis {-}</h1>

<p>Throughout this course, you should use statistical measures when analyzing your data and drawing conclusions.  You are expected to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Record and report the correct number of significant digits.</li>
  <li>Track uncertainties and propagate them in calculations.</li>
  <li>Identify and report sources of error.</li>
  <li>Analyze samples in triplicate and report the mean and standard deviation of your measurements.</li>
  <li>Perform <em>t</em>-tests to compare means when necessary.</li>
  <li>Perform Grubbs’ tests to detect outliers when necessary.</li>
  <li>Determine and report the limit of detection and/or limit of quantitation for each technique when conducting quantitative work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please read Chapter 22 in your textbook for a refresher on statistical data analysis.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-error--">Types of Error {-}</h2>

<p>You will make many mistakes when analyzing your samples, and that’s OK!  The important thing is that you can recognize when you’ve made a mistake and figure out how to correct it.</p>

<h5 id="gross-error--"><strong>Gross Error</strong> {-}</h5>

<p>Gross error occurs when the analyst makes a mistake.  For example, you may make your standards too concentrated, dilute a sample incorrectly, or record a value incorrectly in your lab notebook.  If only one sample is affected, you can use a Grubb’s test to identify the sample as an outlier and exclude it.  If the error affects all your samples, you may need to start over.</p>

<p>See Section 22.2 in your textbook for more information.</p>

<h5 id="systematic-error--"><strong>Systematic Error</strong> {-}</h5>

<p>Systematic error occurs when a measurement is systematically high or low, usually the result of instrument drift, improper calibration, or habitual misuse of laboratory glassware (for example, filling to the top of the meniscus instead of the bottom).  If your systematic error is big enough you may need to redo your analysis.</p>

<p>See Section 22.2 in your textbook for more information.</p>

<h5 id="random-error--"><strong>Random Error</strong> {-}</h5>

<p>Random error occurs due to unpredictable (statistically random) fluctuations in instrument response, pipette delivery volumes, balance fluctations, etc.  A key factor of random error is that it averages out as the sample size increases.  Generally, there is little that can be done to eliminate random error other than increasing the averaging time and/or number of samples.</p>

<p>See Section 22.2 in your textbook for more information.</p>

<h2 id="replicate-measurements--">Replicate Measurements {-}</h2>

<p>Most unknown samples should be analyzed in triplicate.  You should measure the sample three separate times and report the mean, standard deviation, and relative standard deviation of each measurement.  See section 22.4 in your textbook for more information.  An example results table is shown below.</p>

<p><strong>Table 1: Sulfate concentration in multivitamin pills</strong></p>

<p>In Octave, the mean is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">x = [1 2 3];
avg = mean(x);
</code></pre>

<p>The standard deviation is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">x = [1 2 3];
sd = std([1 2 3]);
</code></pre>

<p>The relative standard deviation (RSD, in percent) is:</p>

<pre><code class="language-octave">rsd = sd/avg * 100;
</code></pre>

<h2 id="limits-of-detection-and-quantitation---1">Limits of Detection and Quantitation {-}</h2>

<p>For this course, the <em>Limit of Detection</em> ($LOD_y$) is defined as 3 times the standard deviation of a blank measurement, $y_blank$, plus the mean value of the blank ($\bar{y}_{blank}$).  This is the 3$\sigma$ detection limit and is represented as:</p>

\[LOD_y = \bar{y}_{blank} + 3\sigma_{blank}\]

<p>When a calibration plot (standard curve) is used, this becomes:</p>

\[LOD_x = \frac{3\sigma_{blank}}{m}\]

<p>\noindent where $m$ is the slope of the calibration curve and $LOD_x$ is the LOD in the concentration units of the calibration curve.</p>

<p>The <em>Limit of Quantitation</em> ($LOQ_y$) is defined as 10 times the standard deviation of the blank:</p>

\[LOQ_y = \bar{y}_{blank} + 10\sigma_{blank}\]

<p>When a calibration plot (standard curve) is used, this becomes:</p>

\[LOQ_x = \frac{10\sigma_{blank}}{m}\]

<h2 id="comparing-means--">Comparing Means {-}</h2>

<p>If you are comparing two means or comparing a mean to an expected value (e.g. comparing the concentration of a compound to the concentration listed on the manufacturer’s label), you should use a <em>t</em>-test to draw you conclusions.  A <em>t</em>-test can be performed in Octave using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ttest()</code> function from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">statistics</code> package.</p>

<pre><code class="language-octave"># pkg install -forge statistics ## you only need to run this command once to install
pkg load statistics # load the package every time you restart the kernel.
measurements = rand(1, 10); # this is your sample vector
expected_value = 0.5
[h, p, CI, stats] = ttest(measurements, expected_value);
</code></pre>

<p>If the output is 0, the sample mean is not significantly different from the provided mean at the 95% confidence interval.  If the output is 1, the means are significantly different at the 95% confidence interval.  Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?ttest()</code> in Octave for more information.</p>

<h2 id="outlier-detection--">Outlier Detection {-}</h2>

<p>You should never throw away data unless you have a good reason to do.  Generally, this means that you’ve identified the data point as an outlier using a Grubbs’ test.  See section 22.4 in your textbook for more information.</p>

<!--chapter:end:07_statistical-data-analysis.Rmd-->

<h1 id="appendix-4-lab-notebook-guidelines--">Appendix 4: Lab Notebook Guidelines {-}</h1>

<p><strong><em>Requires update!!</em></strong></p>

<p>Your lab notebook is the single <strong><em>exact, permanent, legally defensible, archival record</em></strong> of what you did in lab.  In an academic setting, notebooks are often used by the person who wrote the notebook or a lab colleague when trying to repeat an experiment, process data, or publish results.  In a professional setting, they may be used to communicate work to new employees, defend against patent lawsuits, or support forensic or toxicological conclusions in a court of law.  A good test of your lab notebook is to imagine handing it to a peer who has never completed the lab.  Then, try to determine if there would enough information for them to (1) complete the lab with no other resources, (2) <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> repeat your data analysis and calculations and arrive at the <strong><em>exact</em></strong> same answer (including all significant digits), and (3) understand your conclusions and how you arrived at those conclusions.  When in doubt, it’s better to include too much than too little!</p>

<p>Instrumental analysis presents unique challenges when it comes to keeping lab notebooks.  Often, the final data collected is a spectrum or chromatogram with thousands of data points.  Instruments save this directly in an electronic format, and archiving it in a paper lab notebook is often unfeasible.  To deal with that, this lab uses electronic lab notebooks.  You should use your electronic lab notebook exactly as you’ve used paper notebooks in the past – record <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> what you did in lab <em>as you do it</em> (not afterwards!).  Include direct observations as necessary.  In addition, you will be required to link all data files to your notebook so that your analysis can be exactly repeated and checked for accuracy.</p>

<p>In an effort to conduct reproducible data analysis, you will use open-source tools for programmatic data analysis.  Your notebook will be kept using <strong>Jupyter</strong> and your data will be analyzed directly in your notebook using <strong>GNU Octave</strong> (similar to MATLAB).</p>

<h3 id="keeping-an-archival-record--">Keeping an Archival Record {-}</h3>

<p>To maintain an archival record, the lab notebook should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contain an <strong><em>exact</em></strong> record of what you <strong><em>did</em></strong> (past tense);</li>
  <li>show <strong><em>all</em></strong> procedures and calculations, instrument parameters, and pertinent conclusions and background information;</li>
  <li>consist of functional code that can be run by another individual with no errors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="writing-your-procedures--">Writing Your Procedures {-}</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Write all procedures in <em>past tense</em>. Do not just copy the handout.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Good:</em> I added 1.0162 g of acetaminophen to a 200-mL volumetric flask and brought to volume with ultrapure water.</li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Bad:</em> <del>Add 1 g of acetaminophen to 200 mL of water.</del></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Explanation:</em> The lab notebook is a record of what you did, not a cookbook.  If you were telling a friend about your vacation you wouldn’t say “Get on a plane. Fly to Europe. Go to hotel.”, you would say “I flew from Atlanta to Paris, and then stayed at a hotel in the city center.”  Your lab notebook is no different.</p>

        <p>More importantly, the difference in significant digits is drastic. In the first example, the results will be limited to 5 significant digits by the balance (the balance reports 4 decimal places, or 5 SF in this case, and the volumetric flask contains 200 +/- 0.15 mL); in the second, all that precision has been thrown away and we’re left with a single significant digit.</p>

        <p>Finally, the second provides no indication as to the purity of the water used, although this is very important for trace instrumental analysis.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Include direct observations.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Good:</em> Upon collection, I saw that the e-cigarette liquid had turned from clear-yellow to clear-brown after aerosolization.</li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Bad:</em> <del>e-Cigarette liquid was collected.</del></p>
      </li>
      <li><em>Explanation:</em> The first example includes pertinent observations of exactly what occurred when the step was performed.  This helps someone who is doing the lab for the first time know what to expect, and helps you remember what happened when you’re going back through your notes.  Importantly, the color change probably indicates a chemical change occured in the sample, which may be worth investigating later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="significant-figures--">Significant Figures {-}</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Balances:</strong> In general, your significant digits should be limited by the balance. The exact number may depend on which balance you use.  Be sure to record all digits on the balance when mass is important, even if they are zeroes; if the last digit fluctuates do the best you can to estimate it.  Remember you do NOT have to weigh out the masses exactly as they appear on the worksheet – what matters is that you get close and that you record the actual <em>exact</em> mass you used!</li>
  <li><strong>Volumetric Glassware:</strong> All volumetric pipettes and flasks should be labeled with the volume of water they deliver or contain at room temperature along with the error associated with that volume.  Use this to determine your significant digits.  Flasks should be used <em>to contain</em> liquid (marked TC) and pipettes should be used <em>to deliver</em> liquid (marked TD); if your pipette has lines for both make sure you use the correct one (TD).</li>
  <li><strong>Graduated cylinders:</strong> For small volumes, these typically have 3 significant digits.  You should interpolate to at least the nearest 0.5 mL when using a graduated cylinder.  Again, there is a large difference between recording 10 ml and 10.5 ml in your notebook in regards to significant figures (1 vs 3)!  Most work in instrumental analysis should use volumetric glassware and not graduated cylinders.</li>
  <li><strong>Beakers/Erlenmeyer Flasks:</strong> These should not be used to measure volumes in instrumental analysis..</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="plots--">Plots {-}</h3>

<p>Plots should be completed to a high degree of quality, as defined in the <a href="/devel/chem370/writing/figures">Publication-quality Figures Guide</a></p>

<h3 id="creating-instrument-tables--">Creating Instrument Tables {-}</h3>

<p>You are expected to provide a table of all relevant instrument information in your lab notebook for each instrument you use.  There is no specific formula for creating these – the information you need depends on the instrument.  The best way to learn what to include is to look at examples, a few of which are linked below.  You will need to look in the instrument method (in the software) and sometimes on the physical instrument itself to find the information you need.  If you’re weary about opening an instrument up to look, please ask for help!</p>

<p><a id="block-diagram"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-block-diagram--">The Block Diagram {-}</h3>

<p>Your block diagram should illustrate the main parts of the instrument and provide clear labels for all parts.  An example of a UV-vis block diagram is shown below.  Notice that the main parts of the instrument are clearly shown with a labels.  Colors, shapes, images, and line thickness are used to convey information as well.  For example, the filter wheel selects green light from the broad-spectrum source so the light path is shown in green after that point.  Likewise, the beam splitter sends a fraction of the beam through the reference cell and the rest to the sample; thus, the line width is varied to show this.</p>

<p>There is no specific formula for creating a block diagram – your goal is to clearly, but succinctly, convey the key components and operating principle behind the instrument.  The best way to learn how to make one is to look at examples.  Your textbook has examples for most (if not all) the instruments it covers, and there are innumerable examples online on the websites of instrument manufacturers, in scientific papers, and in online encyclopedias.  Take a look around and get some ideas, and then make your own. (And don’t just copy one you found!)</p>

<p>Students will be required to attend instrumentation workshops outside of class to learn how to use each instrument.  They will take a multiple-choice test to get a certification for that instrument.  Each student must be certified before using an instrument.  This certification contributes to your grade through SLO #1 on the syllabus.</p>
