**Week 6: Intro to Spectroscopy / Instrument Surveys**

This week we will continue learning how to use the instruments required for the rotation labs and will begin our discussion of spectroscopy (Unit 2).

**To Do:**

1. Watch all the 5.X.X and 6.X.X videos.  
1. Complete the end-of-video quizzes.  There are 4 quizzes, total.  **You must pass these quizzes before using the instruments in lab.**
1. Attend your designated lecture section.
1. (Lab) Turn in [Lab 3]({{site.url}}/chem370/lab-manual/) by 23:59:59 next Wednesday!
1. (Lab) Attend your designated section on Thursday.  You will meet with your lab partner to plan out your rotation lab and get started on sample prep.  You will do whichever lab you chose at the beginning of the semester (vape juice or Tylenol).  Review the memo section of that lab before Thursday.

**Reading:**

- [Chapter 10, section 1](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Analytical_Chemistry/Book%3A_Analytical_Chemistry_2.1_(Harvey)/10%3A_Spectroscopic_Methods/10.01%3A_Overview_of_Spectroscopy) in Harvey.

**Coming Up:**

- You must pass the 4 instrument quizzes by 2020-09-27 to be prepared for the rotation labs.  These quizzes factor into your lab grade.  These take the place of your weekly quizzes for the next two weeks (in other words, there is no quiz due on Sunday, but there are 4 due the following Sunday).
