**Week 5: Unit I Exam / Instrument Surveys**

This week we will have an exam on Unit I: Foundations.  This is Chapters 1-5 of Harvey and Chapter 22 of Granger.

We will also begin learning how to use the instruments required for the rotation labs.

**To Do:**

1. Watch all the 5.X.X videos and complete the end-of-video quizzes.  There are 4 instruments, and thus 4 quizzes, total.  **You must pass these quizzes before using the instruments in lab.  You have two weeks to do this.**
1. (Lab) Start on the [Lab 3]({{site.url}}/chem370/lab-manual/) data processing. Turn in your work by 23:59:59 next Wednesday!
1. Attend your designated lecture section.
1. ***Meet at 10:10 AM in Stillwell 254 on Friday for the exam!***

*There is no in-person lab this week.  Please use the time to complete the data processing for lab 2.*

**Reading:**

- Study for your exam.

**Coming Up:**

- Your second lab assignment is due next Wednesday at midnight.  
- You must pass the 4 instrument quizzes by 2020-09-27 to be prepared for the rotation labs.  These quizzes factor into your lab grade.  These take the place of your weekly quizzes for the next two weeks (in other words, there is no quiz due on Sunday, but there are 4 due the following Sunday).
