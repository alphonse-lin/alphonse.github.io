**Week 13: Happy Thanksgiving!**

This is the last week of class!  We'll review for the final and then take a break for Thanksgiving.

**To Do:**

1. There are no videos this week.  Instead, complete the [exam review]({{site.url}}/chem370/assignments/week15_final_exam_review/). [Answers will be posted later this week.]
1. Last week's videos did not have a quiz, but make sure you watch them before the final. 
1. Turn in your technical reports no later than Sunday 11/29.

*There is no scheduled meeting this week.*
