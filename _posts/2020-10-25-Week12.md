**Week 12: IR Spectroscopy**

This week we will discuss infrared spectroscopy and combine it with MS to assign molecular structures.

**To Do:**

1. Watch all the 12.X.X videos.  
1. Complete the in-video quiz (practice).
1. Complete the end-of-video quiz (graded).  
1. Attend your designated lecture section.
1. (Lab) Attend your designated section on Thursday.  You will continue on the rotation lab.

**Reading:**

- Granger 11.1-11.4, 11.6, 11.8

**Practice Problems:**

- Granger Exercises 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 11.8, 11.10, 11.12

**Coming Up**

- Your full draft lab reports will be due 11/15
- Your 4 lab notebooks will be due 11/22.  All data analysis videos are now posted.

**Other Stuff**

- I posted a [guide]({{site.url}}/chem370/guides/mass-spec) to interpreting mass spectra.  You should be able to complete each step on the sheet for simple mass spectra (methane, ammonia, acetylene, benzene, acetone, etc.).
